Subscriber Confidential Trading Information shall not include information displayed through the IQX Data Feed. Determinations regarding granting access to Subscriber Confidential Trading Information are made on a case-by-case basis.  In making such determinations, the ATS considers the function of the Shared Employees, Imperative Execution employees and the Consultants and the type of Subscriber Confidential Trading Information being accessed.  Individuals with access to Subscriber Confidential Trading Information are only authorized to use such information for its intended purpose and cannot disseminate or give such information to anyone not authorized to receive that information.<br><br>Those individuals responsible for the operation of the ATS have controlled access via unique login credentials to view a Subscriber's orders and trades in the ATS systems.  If an order has been made available to IntelligentCross, it resides on the IntelligentCross server, but such data is only accessible by IntelligentCross operations personnel or Imperative Execution personnel as supervised by IntelligentCross Registered Persons. IntelligentCross requires such personnel to understand the authorized uses of such information and requires such personnel to acknowledge, in the form of an attestation, this understanding.  Personnel undergo annual compliance training that includes materials related to protecting Confidential Trading Information.<br><br>Requests for access to real-time Subscriber Confidential Trading Information must be approved by the CEO/COO of the ATS or their designee.  The requests must be for individuals involved in the operation or compliance functions of the ATS.  IntelligentCross conducts as needed reviews of the individuals that have access to Subscriber Confidential Trading Information to ensure its continued compliance with Rule 301(b)(10).  As part of the review, IntelligentCross confirms that individuals with access to Subscriber Confidential Trading Information continue to have a valid need to access such information.<br><br>IntelligentCross and Imperative Execution maintain information barriers to separate employees, consultants, and systems with access to Subscriber Confidential Trading Information of the ATS from those not permitted to access such information. These information barriers serve as controls to protect Subscriber Confidential Trading Information.  Shared Employees and consultants receive periodic training and periodic guidance regarding the proper use of Subscriber Confidential Trading Information and that Subscriber Confidential Trading Information may only be used with respect to the support and operation of the ATS.<br><br>IntelligentCross protects against unauthorized access to or use of Subscriber Confidential Trading Information by use of a password system.  Login credentials and passwords are required to gain access to systems containing Subscriber Confidential Trading Information.  Passwords are required to be changed periodically and are disabled for terminated individuals or those no longer requiring access.  The ATS does not maintain physical separation barriers.<br><br>With respect to the ATS's service provider Pico, Pico employs a dedicated, segregated management environment to provide secure access for management of customer and customer facing systems. The environment is protected via a defense in-depth strategy, utilizing a combination of firewalls, network access controls, intrusion detection systems and 2-factor authentication. Customer systems and networks utilize access control lists enforcing the appropriate segmentation and prevention of unauthorized access or data exfiltration.  Controls and their effectiveness are actively monitored by a dedicated information security group utilizing a Security Information Event Management system (SIEM), ensuring deviations or anomalies are detected, alerted and reported in a timely manner.<br><br>With respect to Instinet, the ATS's clearing provider, it is a broker dealer that is subject to the various rules and requirements that broker-dealers adhere to as part of their day-to-day operations.

The SOR will access the ATS through direct market access providers that are also Subscribers to the ATS.<br><br>Three types of order and trading information are used in connection with the SOR:<br><br>1)  In order to route orders, the SOR has access to and uses the order detail found in the FIX message sent to IntelligentCross. For example, the SOR uses the price or effective price on an order to determine the order's marketability. The SOR can then use the order's marketability to determine the routing logic for that order.<br><br>2)  Execution data specific to the order being executed can be used by the SOR when an order remains live and partially executed. For example, the SOR can reroute unexecuted shares resting at one venue to another venue based on partial execution data specific to that order. This includes execution data from both the IntelligentCross ATS and external trading centers.<br><br>3)  As part of its smart order routing functionality, the SOR is equipped with a machine learning-based process to optimize order routing decisions based on aggregated information about historical routing and execution results involving orders with similar characteristics that have been previously routed.

Instinet has written policies and procedures reasonably designed to safeguard Subscriber Confidential Trading Information. Instinet's employees' access to Subscriber Confidential Trading Information is dependent upon the level of information that is needed to perform their duties and responsibilities related to providing direct market access ("need to know standard"). Instinet's employees are strictly prohibited from using such information in an unauthorized manner and from discussing the details of any Subscriber Confidential Trading Information with persons who do not need such information to carry out their designated duties and responsibilities. Access to such information is granted as needed to perform these duties and responsibilities (i.e., real-time or delayed, isolated, periodic, or continuous). Access to Subscriber Confidential Trading Information is controlled through permission configurations that provide application access only to entitled users (i.e., users who require access to information to carry out designated duties and responsibilities). Access entitlements are approved by designated supervisors and documented, tracked and monitored. Designated supervisors attest periodically, via an electronic system, that procedures reasonably designed to safeguard and protect Subscriber Confidential Trading Information were followed. Such procedures include reviews of organizational structure including any new or transferred employees as well as reviews of any personal account trades and any related firm/divisional policy violations.  On an annual basis, Instinet's employees (including those with duties and responsibilities related to providing DMA access) participate in compliance training that addresses information protection and client confidentiality.

	             </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">Order Types and Order Type Modifiers<br><br>The ATS operates two different matching models: (1) a Midpoint book ("Midpoint") that only accepts non-displayed midpoint orders and (2) ASPEN (or the "Adverse Selection Protection Engine"), a full limit order book with optional displayed capability.  The ATS uses a matching mechanism which is near-continuous and that matches orders at scheduled times ("Match Events"), as discussed further in Part III, Item 11.<br><br>As discussed further below, Midpoint only accepts Midpoint Peg Orders (which are not accepted in ASPEN).  Any orders entered into IntelligentCross through any other order type (e.g., Market Order, Limit Order, Primary Peg Order (with or without a limit price), and Marketable Peg Order (with or without a limit price)) will default to the ASPEN Fee/Fee book. Only Limit Orders and Primary Peg Orders (with or without a limit price) are eligible to be displayed on the ASPEN Fee/Fee book.<br><br>For Midpoint, only orders that have rested on the order book for a minimum period of time are eligible to match.  Such "Minimum Resting Periods" are determined by the ATS and set in a stock-specific fashion, similar to Match Events.  However, in no event will the minimum resting period exceed 200 milliseconds. There are no Minimum Resting Periods for orders on ASPEN.<br><br>Midpoint Peg Orders<br><br>Midpoint Peg Orders are orders to buy or sell a stated amount of a security that are to be executed only at the midpoint price of the NBBO in the Midpoint book. The ATS will accept Midpoint Peg Orders with or without a limit price.   Midpoint Peg Orders will be non-displayed.<br><br>Midpoint Peg Orders with Time-in-Force Instructions<br><br>The ATS will accept Midpoint Peg Orders with time-in-force instructions.  Midpoint Peg Orders may be so designated, and such orders are orders to buy or sell a stated amount of a security that are to be executed only at the midpoint price of the NBBO in the Midpoint book. The ATS will accept such Peg Orders with or without a limit price, and these orders will be non-displayed. Midpoint Peg Orders with Time-in-Force instructions will be automatically canceled by the ATS within 100 milliseconds of order receipt by the matching engine; 100 milliseconds is the maximum timeframe in which a cancellation will occur. The amount of time until the order will be automatically canceled is calculated from the time of order receipt, and is determined by the ATS and calibrated on a security-by-security basis.  The time period until automatic cancellation will be longer than or equal to the "Minimum Resting Period" (as discussed further in Part III, Item 11).  The time period until automatic cancellation may be less than the time between Match Events such that the order may be canceled without participating in a Match Event.  For example, if, for a particular security, the time period until automatic cancellation is 20 milliseconds but the time between Match Events is 30 milliseconds, it is possible that an order would be entered by a Subscriber and be automatically canceled before the first Match Event subsequent to order entry.   The factors that contribute to determining the amount of time until an order is canceled include time of day, price reaction after trades, volume and volatility in the security, average spread, trade size, and other market factors.  The time until cancellation is adjusted after enough data points have been accumulated to warrant an adjustment.  A Subscriber may cancel such a Midpoint Peg Order at any time before the order is fully executed or the ATS cancels the order.<br><br>Below is an example of the operation of a Midpoint Peg Order with Time-in-Force instructions:<br><br>Security XYZ has a Match Event Interval to occur between 7 to 12 milliseconds apart.<br><br>The next Match Event is scheduled at 10:01:04:010.<br><br>At 10:01:04:000, Subscriber A submits a 1000 share Midpoint Peg buy order with a limit price of $25.06 to participate in the Midpoint book for Security XYZ.  Assume that the time period until the Midpoint Peg Order is automatically canceled for Security XYZ is 30 milliseconds.<br><br>At 10:01:04:005, Subscriber B submits a 500 share sell order with no limit price and a TIF of Day to participate in the Midpoint book for Security XYZ.<br><br>At the next scheduled Match Event for Security XYZ, (10:01:04:010), the matching engine retrieves the NBBO and determines that the NBBO is $25.05 by $25.07. The Midpoint price at the time of the Match Event is $25.06 and is the Matching Price.  Assuming that Subscriber A's and Subscriber B's orders have met the minimum resting period, Subscriber A will match 500 shares with Subscriber B at $25.06 during the Match Event at 10:01:04:010.  Subscriber A's remaining order for 500 shares is eligible to participate in any subsequent Midpoint Match Event occurring prior to the automatic cancellation of the order by the ATS at 10:01:04:030.<br><br>Primary Peg Orders<br><br>Primary Peg Orders are orders to buy at the NBB, or sell at the NBO, a stated amount of a security that are to be executed only in ASPEN. Orders may be submitted with or without a limit price.  Primary Peg Orders may be displayed or non-displayed at the Subscriber's discretion.  If a displayed Primary Peg Order would lock or cross contra-side interest displayed inside the ATS or as part of the NBBO, such order will be displayed one minimum price variation less aggressive than the price of displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or as part of the NBBO and ranked at the price of displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or as part of the NBBO.  In the event the displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or the NBBO updates, such order's displayed price will be updated to the most aggressive price permissible without locking displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or the NBBO, up to the order's limit price, and such order's ranked price will be updated to the most aggressive price permissible without crossing displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or the NBBO, up to the order's limit price.<br><br>Marketable Peg Orders<br><br>Marketable Peg Orders are orders to buy at or below the NBO, or sell at or<br>above the NBB, a stated amount of a security that are to be executed only in the ASPEN book. Orders may be submitted with or without a limit price.  Marketable Peg Orders will be non-displayed.<br><br>Limit Orders<br><br>Limit Orders are orders to buy or sell a stated amount of a security at a specified price or better that are to be executed only in the ASPEN book..  Limit Orders may be displayed or non-displayed at the Subscriber's discretion.  If a displayed Limit Order would lock or cross contra-side interest displayed inside the ATS or as part of the NBBO, such order will be displayed one minimum price variation less aggressive than the price of displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or as part of the NBBO and ranked at the price of the displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or as part of the NBBO.  In the event the displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or the NBBO updates, such order's displayed price will be updated to the most aggressive price permissible without locking displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or the NBBO, up to the order's limit price, and such order's ranked price will be updated to the most aggressive price permissible without crossing displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or the NBBO, up to the order's limit price.<br><br>Market Orders<br><br>Market Orders are orders to buy or sell a stated amount of a security that is to be executed at or in between the NBBO only in ASPEN.  Market Orders will be non-displayed.<br><br>Add Liquidity Only<br><br>Subscribers may designate orders as Add Liquidity Only ("ALO"). ALO orders are to be entered only in ASPEN. ALO orders are Limit or Primary Peg orders that rest on the order book instead of the order being able to execute against contra interests that are already on the book at the same price or better price. ALO orders will only interact with other orders if the ALO order would be adding liquidity. Generally, for two given orders the one received first by the matching engine will be deemed to be adding liquidity.<br><br>Time-in-Force<br><br>The ATS will accept orders with time-in-force instructions of Day, IOC, and Good Till Time. Day will be the default time-in-force instruction.  Day orders will be held by the ATS on its books from the time of receipt until the end of Regular Trading Hours. If unfulfilled by the end of Regular Trading Hours, such Day orders will be canceled and the Subscriber who submitted the order will be notified. IOC orders in ASPEN will be held until the completion of the next Match Event, and if unexecuted, will be canceled.  IOC in combination with the Midpoint Peg instruction is processed as a Midpoint Peg Order with Time-in-Force Instruction.  IOC orders may be submitted with or without a limit price.  IOC orders will be non-displayed.  Good Till Time orders are eligible for use in the Midpoint book and Hosted Pools and will be held by the ATS on its books from the time of receipt for an amount of time specified by the Subscriber in milliseconds, and if unexecuted, will be canceled.  A Good Till Time order will be held for a time that allows it to participate in at least one Match Event even if the order would normally be canceled prior to the Match Event.<br><br>Not Held<br><br>All orders entered into the ATS by Subscribers are Not Held.<br><br>Open Orders<br>All open orders are canceled at the end of the trading day.<br><br>Routing<br><br>IntelligentCross does not support the routing of orders to any other venue.<br><br>Message Priority<br><br>Incoming orders and related messages are processed in the order in which they are received by the ATS.<br><br>Match Priority<br><br>Generally, an order's match priority will be based on price, display type (for ASPEN), and the time at which such order is received relative to other orders.  With respect to ASPEN, at each price level, displayed orders will have priority over non-displayed orders.  All orders will be timestamped and accordingly prioritized based on the time of their receipt by the ATS.  Matching instructions are specified in accordance with the FIX protocols described above in Part III, Item 5 and defined by industry standard FIX tags defined for these matching instructions.<br><br>Orders received by the ATS during the Pre-Market Order Acceptance Period will be queued until the beginning of Regular Trading Hours and then matched with time priority based on the order receipt by the ATS. Orders received outside these periods will not be accepted.  For all eligible securities, the ATS will only execute if Limit-Up-Limit-Down ("LULD") bands are present and the effective price of a potential match is not constrained by a LULD band.<br><br>Order Amendment<br><br>An open order may be amended by Subscribers to the extent the amendment is received by the ATS before a Match Event involving that order occurs. Order amendments are processed in the order in which they are received by the ATS.   The match priority of an order will be preserved when amending the quantity of an order to a value less than the existing quantity of the order; however, the match priority of an order will be lost when amending the quantity of an order to a value greater than the existing quantity or when amending any other value in addition to the quantity of the order.<br><br>Order Cancellation<br><br>An open order may be canceled by Subscribers to the extent the cancellation order is received by the ATS before a Match Event involving that order occurs. Cancellation orders will cancel all remaining open quantity on an order. Cancellation orders are processed in the order in which they are received by the ATS.<br><br>Hosted Pools<br><br>At the request of one or more Subscribers, the ATS will setup a Hosted Pool where such Subscriber(s) may designate that an order interact with other orders entered by that same Subscriber or other Subscribers participating in the same Hosted Pool.  Subscribers may enter such orders in either a principal or agency capacity.  An order designated to interact within a Hosted Pool can also be designated to interact with the liquidity outside the Hosted Pool after checking for liquidity available in the Hosted Pool.  In particular, during a Match Event, the matching engine will, in sequential order: (1) match orders eligible to be matched in Hosted Pools, and then (2) match orders outside the Hosted Pool, including orders designated to interact first in a Hosted Pool and then outside a Hosted Pool.  The ATS's Hosted Pools accept "Conditional Orders."  Conditional Orders are not accepted outside of the ATS's Hosted Pools.  The ATS' Hosted Pools permit the publication of indications of interest ("IOIs"), which allow participants of a Hosted Pool to send IOIs to any other participant of that Hosted Pool.  IOIs contain symbol, side and size.  See Part III, Item 9 for a discussion of Conditional Orders and IOIs.<span>&nbsp;</span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

Subscribers choose which matching model to which they send their orders.  While the matching models operate under the same "market participant identifier" (or "MPID") - INCR - each matching model is distinct and does not interact with the other matching model.<br><br>The ASPEN matching model has three distinct books distinguished by different fee structures - ASPEN Fee/Fee, ASPEN Maker/Taker and ASPEN Taker/Maker.  All three books act independent of each other; orders resting in one book do not rest on or interact with orders resting in another book.

Any orders entered into IntelligentCross through any other order type (e.g., Market Order, Limit Order, Primary Peg Order (with or without a limit price), and Marketable Peg Order (with or without a limit price)) will default to the ASPEN Fee/Fee book.

	              </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The ATS accepts orders in all NMS Stocks eligible for trading (e.g., those that are not subject to a trading halt) and uses a matching mechanism which is near-continuous and that matches orders at scheduled times ("Match Events").  The ATS' two different matching models - Midpoint and ASPEN - contain the following characteristics (any differences between the matching models will be noted accordingly).<br><br>Determination of Matching Schedule<br><br>Matching schedules are calculated using an optimization process that uses, among other things, historical performance measurements (as discussed below) from prior days' and/or current days' (in the case of Midpoint) matches.  Each security has an individualized matching schedule, computed to maximize price stability after trades. The optimization process is data driven and takes into account stock by stock volatility, spreads, daily trading volume, price stability after trades and other market factors characteristic of how the specific stock recently traded in the market and on the IntelligentCross platform.<br><br>For ASPEN, matching schedules are calculated using an overnight optimization process that uses historical performance measurements from prior days' matches.  Each day starts with a prepared matching schedule for each security that does not change throughout the day.<br><br>For Midpoint, the matching schedule for a security may change overnight, or during the trading day if the ATS's machine-learning process determines that such change is appropriate to maximize price stability after trades. For Midpoint, while the matching schedule for a security may change during the trading day, the model governing the optimization process does not change throughout the trading day. The optimization process takes into account publicly available market data such as prior SIP trades and NBBO quotes. There is no human intervention or discretion involved in any change to the matching schedule during the trading day, and any such change does not alter any conditions (including price) of any orders nor is it aware of or responsive to any customer specific information.<br><br>Match Events in each security occur at scheduled times as determined by the ATS' matching algorithm.  Match schedules are defined by "minimum/maximum time bands" for each security ("Match Event Intervals").  Midpoint has Match Event Intervals between 150 microseconds and up to 200 milliseconds that are calibrated on a security-by-security basis.  ASPEN's Match Event Intervals can have a minimum time of 150 microseconds and a maximum time of 900 microseconds (i.e., the maximum time for scheduling a match event is capped at 900 microseconds), also calibrated on a security-by-security basis.  For example, on a particular day, the match event band for XYZ stock may have a minimum time of 450 microseconds and a maximum time of 600 microseconds.  The actual match event time is randomized within the match event band throughout the course of the trading day.<br><br>Execution of Orders and Match Events<br><br>Any order for a security that arrives prior to a Match Event for that security (and that has not been canceled, has become unmarketable, or has been repriced prior to the match event) will be eligible to participate in the next Match Event.  Match Events are scheduled continuously while the book is in a "matchable state" (i.e., there is an order on each side eligible to match); if there are no orders for a stock in the book, no Match Event will be scheduled.  An incoming order that will make the book potentially matchable will trigger a scheduling of a Match Event if one has not already been scheduled.<br><br>The matching process is completely symmetric, i.e., the match times within IntelligentCross are not chosen to favor a particular side of the trade.  No Subscribers (or non-Subscribers accessing IntelligentCross through a Subscriber) are given any type of priority through the matching process, and the matching process is blind to the identity of the Subscriber (or a non-Subscriber accessing IntelligentCross through a Subscriber). Both sides of the trade (buyers and sellers) are on equal footing for the next scheduled match, while maintaining full control of their orders - both sides can cancel or update their orders at any time prior to the match.<br><br>Open orders may be amended to the extent the amendment is received before a match event involving that order occurs.  Order amendments are processed in the order in which they are received by the ATS. The match priority of an order will be preserved when amending the quantity of an order to a value less than the existing quantity of the order; however, the match priority of an order will be lost when amending the quantity of an order to a value greater than the existing quantity or when amending any other value in addition to the quantity of the order.<br><br>An open order also may be canceled to the extent the cancellation order is received before a match event involving that order occurs.  The ATS will automatically update its quotations, and all quotation updates, including those due to new or canceled orders, are immediate.<br><br>Midpoint Match Event Process and Match Event Intervals<br><br>At each Match Event for each security in Midpoint, the matching engine for the Midpoint book will retrieve the current NBBO and check its book for orders that can be matched.  Orders eligible for matching will be matched in time priority at the NBBO midpoint price at the Match Event.  The purpose of the scheduled matches is to achieve two objectives: (1) provide for as many matches as possible to maximize liquidity; and (2) keep the NBBO as stable as possible for a period of time after executions occur on the ATS. During the time between Match Events, Subscribers have full order control and can cancel or reprice orders until the next Match Event.<br><br>The ATS then analyzes the executions that occur on the ATS, including in Hosted Pools, and adjusts the Match Event Interval to achieve the two objectives described above. The optimization process takes into account publicly available market data such as prior SIP trades and NBBO quotes. The optimization process is data driven and takes into account stock by stock volatility, spreads, daily trading volume, price stability after trades and other market factors characteristic of how the specific stock recently traded in the market and on the IntelligentCross platform.<br><br>The Match Event Intervals per security are adjusted after enough data points have been accumulated to warrant an adjustment.<br><br>Below is an example of how the Midpoint matching process works using Match Event Intervals. The assumptions include:<br><br>- Security XYZ has a Match Event Interval between 7 to 12 milliseconds.<br><br>- The next Match Event is scheduled at 10:01:04:003.<br><br>- Subscriber A has submitted a 500 share buy order with a limit price of $25.06 and TIF of Day for Security XYZ.<br><br>- Subscriber B has submitted a 200 share buy order with a limit price of $25.07 and TIF of Day for Security XYZ (this order was received after Subscriber A's order so Subscriber A has priority over Subscriber B).<br><br>- Subscriber C submits a 600 share sell order with no limit price and a TIF of Day for Security XYZ.<br><br>At the next scheduled Match Event for Security XYZ, (10:01:04:003), the matching engine retrieves the NBBO and determines that the NBBO is $25.05 by $25.07. The Midpoint price at the time of the Match Event is $25.06 and is the matching price. As a result, the following executions occur during the Match Event at 10:01:04:003.<br><br>Subscriber A will match 500 shares with Subscriber C at $25.06.<br><br>Subscriber B will match 100 shares with Subscriber C at $25.06.<br><br>Subscriber A's 500 share order has been fully filled.<br><br>Subscriber B received a fill of 100 shares and has 100 shares remaining that will be eligible for the next Match Event.<br><br>Subscriber C's 600 share order has been fully filled.<br><br>The next Match Event will be at a time between 10:01:04:010 and 10:01:04:015 because the last match event was at 10:01:04:003 and the Match Event Intervals are between 7 and 12 milliseconds apart.  This process will continue throughout the trading day.<br><br>The ATS makes a determination as to whether the Match Event Intervals for each security should be increased, decreased, or stay the same.  The Match Event Intervals for Midpoint may be recalibrated throughout the day.  Registered Persons of the ATS review and approve such changes.<br><br>In the example described above, the Match Event Intervals could increase, stay the same, or decrease.<br><br>ASPEN Match Event Process and Match Event Intervals<br><br>ASPEN will have Match Event Intervals between 150 and 900 microseconds that are calibrated on a security-by-security basis. The matching process and process for determining the Match Event Intervals for ASPEN is similar to that for Midpoint but Match Event Intervals are calibrated separately such that, for any given security, the Match Event Intervals for ASPEN will be different from the Match Event Intervals for Midpoint. The Match Event Intervals for the three ASPEN books will be the same for a given security.<br><br>Below is an example of how the ASPEN matching process works using Match Event Intervals. The assumptions include:<br><br>- Security XYZ has a Match Event Interval between 175 to 200 microseconds.<br><br>- The next Match Event is scheduled at 10:01:04:003:005.<br><br>- Subscriber A has submitted a 500 share buy limit order with a limit price of $25.06 and TIF of Day for Security XYZ.<br><br>- Subscriber B has submitted a 200 share buy limit order with a limit price of $25.07 and TIF of Day for Security XYZ.<br><br>- Subscriber C submits a 600 share sell market order with no limit price and TIF of Day for Security XYZ.<br><br>At the next scheduled Match Event for Security XYZ (10:01:04:003:005), the matching engine retrieves the NBBO and determines that the NBBO is $25.05 by $25.07. As a result, the following executions occur during the Match Event at 10:01:04:003:005:<br><br>Subscriber B will match 200 shares with Subscriber C at $25.07.<br><br>Subscriber A will match 400 shares with Subscriber C at $25.06.<br><br>Subscriber B's 200 share order has been fully filled.<br><br>Subscriber A received a fill of 400 shares and has 100 shares remaining that will be eligible for the next Match Event.<br><br>Subscriber C's 600 share order has been fully filled at prices of $25.06 and $25.07.<br><br>The next Match Event will be at a time between 10:01:04:003:180 and 10:01:04:003:205 because the last match event was at 10:01:04:003:005 and the Match Event Intervals are between 175 and 200 microseconds apart.  This process will continue throughout the trading day.<br><br>The ATS makes a daily determination as to whether the Match Event Intervals for each security should be increased, decreased, or stay the same. In the example described above the Match Event Intervals could increase, stay the same, or decrease.<br><br>Midpoint Minimum Resting Period<br><br>For Midpoint, only orders that have rested on the order book for a minimum period of time are eligible to match.  "Minimum Resting Periods" are determined by the ATS and set in a stock-specific fashion, similar to Match Events.  The purpose of these periods is to further reduce adverse selection.  However, in no event will the minimum resting period exceed 200 milliseconds. There are no Minimum Resting Periods for orders on ASPEN.<br><br>Anti-Internalization<br><br>The ATS provides an "anti-internalization" setting to its Subscribers.  This setting can be enabled upon client request and will prevent the self-matching of two orders from the same Subscriber on the ATS's order books. This setting will not be enabled by default, but can be enabled upon Subscriber request and will be enforced by the Client ID setting.  Subscribers can either contact IntelligentCross Trading Operations to enable this functionality on an MPID basis or they can configure the trading systems to prevent self-crossing at a client or trading desk level.<br><br>Locked or Crossed Market<br><br>The ATS will not match if the NBBO as determined by the SIP and/or SRO proprietary data feeds for the stock is crossed (where the NBB price exceeds the NBO price) or if the NBBO as determined by the SIP and/or other SRO proprietary data feeds is locked (where the NBB price equals the NBO price).  In ASPEN, if a displayed Limit Order or Primary Peg Order would lock or cross displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or the NBBO, such order will be displayed one minimum price variation less aggressive than the price of the displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or as part of the NBBO and ranked at the price of displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or as part of the NBBO.  In the event the displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or the NBBO updates, such order's displayed price will be updated to the most aggressive price permissible without locking displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or as part of the NBBO, up to the order's limit price, and such order's ranked price will be updated to the most aggressive price permissible without crossing displayed contra-side interest inside the ATS or as part of the NBBO, up to the order's limit price.<br><br>Sub-Dollar Pricing<br><br>For orders in Midpoint, in the event that the NBB is less than $1.00, the ATS will execute orders at the midpoint price, regardless of the number of decimal places.<br><br>For orders in ASPEN, in the event that the NBB is less than $1.00, the ATS will execute orders at valid prices within the NBBO.<br><br>Orders Eligible for Matching<br><br>With respect to the Midpoint book, the following orders will be eligible for matching during a Match Event:<br><br>1. Midpoint Peg Orders that are buy orders with limit prices equal to or higher than NBBO midpoint.<br>2. Midpoint Peg Orders that are sell orders with limit prices equal to or lower than NBBO midpoint.<br>3. Midpoint Peg Orders without limit prices.<br><br>Midpoint Peg Orders also may be designated with Time-in-Force instructions.<br><br>With respect to the ASPEN books, the following orders will be eligible for matching during a Match Event:<br><br>1. Primary Peg Orders with no limit price or those with limit prices that are within the prevailing NBBO at the time of a Match Event.<br>2. Market Peg Orders with no limit price or those with limit prices that can execute within the prevailing NBBO at the time of a Match Event.<br>3. Limit Orders with limit prices that are within the prevailing NBBO at the time of a Match Event.<br>4. Market Orders.<br><br>Match Priority Criteria<br><br>Generally, an order's match priority will be based on price, display type (for ASPEN), and the time at which such order is received relative to other orders.  With respect to ASPEN, at each price level, displayed orders will have priority over non-displayed orders.  All orders will be timestamped and accordingly prioritized based on the time of their receipt by the ATS.  Matching instructions are specified in accordance with the FIX protocols described above in Part III, Item 5 and defined by industry standard FIX tags defined for these matching instructions.<br><br>Orders received by the ATS during the Pre-Market Order Acceptance Period will be queued until the beginning of Regular Trading Hours and then matched with time priority based on the order receipt by the ATS. Orders received outside these periods will not be accepted.  For all eligible securities, the ATS will only execute if Limit-Up-Limit-Down ("LULD") bands are present and the effective price of a potential match is not constrained by a LULD band.<br><br>An amendment of an outstanding order will affect its match priority and Minimum Resting Period as follows:<br><br>1.If an order's size is decreased, its timestamp will remain the same, its priority will not change and it will not wait through a new Minimum Resting Period (in the case of Midpoint).<br>2.If an order's size is increased, the timestamp will be renewed, its priority will change and, if part of Midpoint, it will wait through a new Minimum Resting Period.<br>3.If an order's price is changed, the timestamp will be renewed, its priority will change and, if part of Midpoint, it will wait through a new Minimum Resting Period.<br><br>IntelligentCross conducts trading strictly in an agency capacity on the ATS.  IntelligentCross does not conduct trading in a proprietary capacity.<br><br>Non-Match Events<br><br>Situations may occur where an incoming order may not execute against a resting order at match event time, such as when:<br><br>(1) an existing resting order cancels prior to the next match event<br>(2) an incoming order is canceled prior to the next match event<br>(3) the NBBO moves between the time an order is received and the next match event takes place, making either the incoming order or the resting order non-marketable<br>(4) the NBBO changed before the next match event and pegged orders were repriced to the new NBBO, making the incoming order or the resting pegged order non-marketable<br><br>Execution Errors<br><br>The ATS has written supervisory policies and procedures in place to handle trade execution errors and "clearly erroneous trades."  Each potential error situation will be evaluated by the ATS' personnel on a case by-case basis.<br><br>If a trade is transacted in error and it is determined that the error was due to a system failure or other issue with the ATS' platform that resulted in a poor execution (i.e., outside the NBBO), the ATS will contact each of the Subscribers associated with the error cross trade and inform them that the ATS is canceling the trade. The ATS will then initiate the cancel on the ATS and communicate either electronically (ACT Web for NASDAQ TRF) or over the telephone (NYSE TRF) the trade report cancellation for each side of the cross trade. In the instances in which the trade was good (i.e., inside the NBBO), and as a result of a systems issue, the ATS failed to acknowledge the execution to one of the two Subscribers associated with the error cross trade transacted on the ATS, the ATS will contact the affected Subscriber and ask whether or not they want to maintain (keep) the trade. If the Subscriber does not want to maintain the trade, the ATS will take the affected Subscriber's position and book it to IntelligentCross' error account. IntelligentCross will then instruct IntelligentCross' clearing broker to trade out of the error position. An IntelligentCross employee will book the error position and subsequently close-out the transaction through IntelligentCross' error account for settlement purposes and document within IntelligentCross' systems all details regarding the error transaction(s). The error transaction detail will include all details surrounding the error trade(s) and subsequent close-out trades (if any). The detail will also include an identification of all associated parties, the cause/reason for the error, or details surrounding Subscriber contact(s). The error trade detail will then be reviewed and electronically signed off as "compliance review" by the CCO or his designee and subsequently reviewed and signed off on as "Supervisory Review" by IntelligentCross' CEO or his/her supervisory principal designee.<br><br>The ATS will also ensure accurate CAT reporting.<br><br>With respect to a market wide event that may contain clearly erroneous transaction, the ATS monitors all email notification regarding clearly erroneous transactions. Upon receipt of a clearly erroneous e-mail notification, the ATS will immediately review the ATS's trading activity during the relevant timeframe to determine whether or not the ATS traded the securities referenced in the notification. The ATS will then take immediate action (if any executions have been identified through the review) to reverse the trades upon the ATS and NASDAQ's WebLink ACT. A file in IntelligentCross' systems will be created that documents any ACT reversals that have been performed as a result of a clearly erroneous notification.<br><br>Order Entry Restrictions<br><br>The ATS will not accept orders that reference a symbol not authorized for trading (e.g., if there is a trading halt). The minimum price variation ("MPV") for orders received by the ATS shall be $0.01 for orders priced $1.00 or greater, and $0.0001 for orders priced below $1.00. Orders received with increments below the MPV will be rejected.<br><br>Sell orders must be designated as long, short or short exempt in the event there is a short sale restriction in place. Subscribers are responsible for the compliance of their trades with all short sale locate and delivery rules and regulations.<br><br>Anonymity<br><br>All orders and executions are anonymous as to and between Subscribers. Subscribers are only made aware of IntelligentCross as a party or contra-party on orders and executions.<br><br>The ATS does not provide any means of communication between Subscribers. There is no negotiation, chat, instant message, indication of interest, "Flash Order," or similar functionality provided.<br><br>Hosted Pools<br><br>At the request of one or more Subscribers, the ATS will setup a Hosted Pool where such Subscriber(s) may designate that an order interact with other orders entered by that same Subscriber or other Subscribers participating in the same Hosted Pool.  Unless otherwise stated, the matching and trading rules in a Hosted Pool are the same as in the ATS.  Subscribers participating in a Hosted Pool may request that orders designated for the Midpoint book and the ASPEN book have the ability to interact with each other inside the Hosted Pool.  When such an option is selected, any eligible orders will interact at each Match Event, regardless if the next Match Event is for Midpoint book-eligible orders or ASPEN book-eligible orders.<br><br>Subscribers may designate an order to interact within a Hosted Pool, as well as to interact with the liquidity outside the Hosted Pool after checking for liquidity in the Hosted Pool.    In particular, at each Match Event, the matching engine will, in sequential order, (1) match orders eligible to be matched in Hosted Pools, and then (2) match orders outside the Hosted Pool, including orders designated to interact first in a Hosted Pool and then outside a Hosted Pool.<br><br>The ATS's Hosted Pools accept "Conditional Orders" and permit the publication of IOIs.  Conditional Orders are not accepted outside of the ATS's Hosted Pools.   IOIs are only published to other participants of the same Hosted Pool. See Part III, Item 9 for a discussion of Conditional Orders and IOIs.<span>&nbsp;</span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">
