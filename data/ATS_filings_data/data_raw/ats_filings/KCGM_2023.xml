The Firm<br>operates MatchIt on a matching engine that runs on a standalone server in the NY5 Data Center.<br>See Part I, Item 7; and Part III, Item 6(a).  The MatchIt matching engine communicates with<br>shared systems to book trades, to report executed trades to the tape, to facilitate clearance and<br>settlement, for financial reporting and billing, and to facilitate other post-trade processes.  See Part<br>II, Item 6 for information on personnel that have access to Confidential Information.<br>AGGREGATED ANONYMOUS DATA.  Data which has been aggregated and which does not<br>identify any Subscribers is not Confidential Information ("Aggregated Anonymous Data").  The<br>Firm publishes firm-wide aggregated anonymous execution data to market wide trade<br>advertisement systems after the transaction has been reported to the consolidated tape.  The data<br>does not include any client identities but does include symbol level executed volumes.  'While the<br>Firm does not consider this data to be Confidential Information, it does not include MatchIT<br>Aggregated Anonymous data in these reports.<br>The Firm posts monthly statistics on its website and disseminates this data to Subscribers ("the<br>Monthly MatchIt Statistics").  The Monthly MatchIt Statistics are available at<br>https://www.virtu.com/about/transparency and provide aggregate and anonymous information<br>about MatchIt, including total volume; volume by sector; volume by market cap; fill size<br>distribution; and distribution of executions at the bid, mid and offer.  The Firm produces market<br>commentary from time-to-time that discusses general market trends.  The statistical data described<br>in this paragraph can be used to produce market commentary.  The Firm considers this data to be<br>Aggregated Anonymous Data and not Confidential Information.  The Firm does not permit<br>Subscribers to opt out of having their data included in these reports.<br>SALES DATA.  Sales Data is aggregated information about the products and services the Firm's<br>clients use and includes the client's name, the product or service they use, aggregate executed<br>volume, and revenues ("Sales Data").  Sales Data includes aggregated ATS data as described in the<br>preceding sentence.  The Firm provides Sales Data to management personnel, Sales or Trading<br>personnel and Relationship Management personnel who are involved in handling relationships<br>with the Firm's clients.  Sales Data is provided for the purpose of allowing these personnel to keep<br>abreast of the client's business activities to manage the client relationship and to cross sell the<br>Firm's products and services to the client.  The Firm does not consider Sales Data to be<br>Confidential Information when distributed internally for the above described purposes.  The Firm<br>makes this information available in end of day reports and in sales systems (i.e., systems that<br>support activities of Sales or Trading personnel and Relationship Management personnel for the<br>purposes described above) on T+1.  The Firm prohibits personnel from disclosing Sales Data to<br>third parties.  The Firm does not permit Subscribers to opt out of having this data made available<br>to personnel involved in handling client relationships, as defined in Part II, Item 6(a).<br>PERSONNEL WITH ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

The shared personnel<br>discussed in response to Part II, Item 6(a), have access to Confidential Information.<br>SAFEGUARDS AND OVERSEEING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

Firm<br>personnel are subject to its parent, Virtu Financial Inc.'s Code of Conduct and Employee Manual.<br>Firm personnel are also subject to the Firm's Information Security Policy, Compliance Manual,<br>and Written Supervisory Procedures.<br>These policies prohibit the personnel listed in Part II, Item 6(a), from sharing Confidential<br>Information with other personnel who are not in one of these permitted categories or with any<br>other person.  The exception is that Compliance and Legal personnel may provide information to<br>regulators in response to regulatory requests or to third parties pursuant to subpoena.  Personnel<br>who violate the Firm's policies concerning Confidential Information are subject to discipline,<br>including termination of their employment.  The Firm performs email reviews and employs data<br>loss software as a means of safeguarding Confidential Information.<br>The Firm procedures require that personnel make requests for access to its systems through the<br>Firm's access ticketing system and to receive approval from a supervisor prior to being granted<br>access to any systems.  The Firm's supervisory personnel grant access to systems on the premise<br>that it is necessary to perform their duties and to carry out the purpose for which the information is<br>provided to them.  The supervisor responsible for MatchIt approves requests for access to the<br>MatchIt matching engine.  The Firm only permits approved personnel in the categories described<br>in Part II, Item 6(a), to have access to Confidential Information and only permits these personnel<br>to access the systems and the Confidential Information contained therein using approved means of<br>access and credentials.  Supervisors do not grant access to Confidential Information. The Firm<br>maintains a process that sends notifications to designated personnel to disable systems access for<br>personnel who are no longer employed by the Firm.  Supervisors are responsible for instructing the<br>technology personnel to disable access when employees change roles.  The Firm provides reports<br>to the supervisors that show personnel with access to the MatchIt matching engine on a monthly<br>basis.  Supervisors review these reports to ensure that these personnel still require access to carry<br>out responsibilities related to the ATS.<br>PERSONAL TRADING RESTRICTIONS.

A client that does not have sufficient net capital or a clearing firm with sufficient net capital to satisfy the Firm's counterparty risk criteria would similarly be precluded from becoming a client of the Firm's and consequently not be permitted access to the ATS. A client who holds less than $500,000 in capital will only be granted access if: there is a formal request with business head approval; the nature of the business flow is such that large MTM exposures are unlikely; and the revenues provide sufficient risk vs. reward ratios, or the company is part of a larger group and there are explicit or implicit guarantees, or there is a high degree of confidence the company will grow.<br>The Product Manager for the ATS approves or denies access to the ATS. Clients who are not approved for access to the ATS would generally also not be approved for any other VAL services.<br>Indirect Subscribers are not required to be broker-dealers but would otherwise go through the same on-boarding process. VAL generally only on-boards clients to use algorithms that are broker-dealers or institutional type clients and does not accept natural persons as clients.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

				  </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">There is no segmentation in the Conditional Session. In the Main Session, VAL segments Direct Subscribers into five distinct Liquidity Profiles based upon their removal orders. Direct Subscribers may enter instructions that when present on liquidity adding orders will prevent interaction with liquidity taking orders from Subscribers who fall into specified Liquidity Profiles. VAL scores and segments Direct Subscribers at the MPID level. VAL and its Affiliates' own MPIDs are scored and segmented. VAL does not score and segment Indirect Subscribers. To the extent that VAL, its Affiliates or Direct Subscriber's transmit the orders of multiple Indirect Subscribers through a single MPID, the Liquidity Profile will be the composite of all of the Indirect Subscribers. An exception is that VAL permits Direct Subscribers to have different order flows scored independently based upon a Segment ID FIX tag. The Current MatchIt FIX Specification Document provides Direct Subscribers the ability to use up to four Segment IDs labeled Segment 1, Segment 2, Segment 3 and Segment 4.<br>VAL uses a scoring methodology to determine a Subscriber's Liquidity Profiles that is derived from the price move of a stock from the midpoint price at the time of fill to a weighted average of midpoint prices of various durations after the time of fill, divided by the stock's spread (a "mark out"). Only a Subscriber's removal flow (IOC orders and Day orders that remove liquidity) are included in the Liquidity Profile computation. Liquidity Profiles are generated monthly, based on the prior 3 months of trading activity. There is no de minimis volume rule in the Liquidity Profile generation.<br>VAL creates Liquidity Profiles by sorting Subscribers by their mark-out score. The five Liquidity Profile tiers are called Highest, High, Neutral, Low, and Lowest, where the Highest Liquidity Profile contains Subscribers who exhibit the lowest mark outs relative to other Subscribers' taking flow, and the Lowest Liquidity Profile contains Subscribers who exhibit the largest mark outs (in the Subscribers favor) relative to other Subscribers' taking flow. The Liquidity Profiles are constructed such that approximately 40% of the taking share volume is placed into the Highest category, 20% of the taking share volume is placed in the High category, 20% of the taking share volume is placed in the Neutral category, 10% of the taking share volume is placed in the Low category, and 10% of the taking share volume is placed in the Lowest category. The percentages are approximations. Based on the mix of Subscribers' share volume, they may not perfectly fit into a quintile such that the percentages are exact. MatchIt will use its discretion in these circumstances and typically will elect to include more Subscribers in a higher quintile. Subscribers that rest Day orders in MatchIt can elect to prevent various combinations of the quintiles from interacting with their resting orders on an order by order basis via FIX tag. VAL uses its own discretion to place new Subscribers into a quintile. Quintile selection for new Subscribers is based on VAL's subjective judgment of the trading and investment process employed by the new Subscriber. VAL reserves the right to move a Subscriber's liquidity profile bucket intra-month if that Subscriber's mark outs during the month deviate widely from prior trading activity.<br>Direct Subscribers who add liquidity can block any of the liquidity profile buckets from interacting with their add flow. As an example, if a Subscriber specifies that their Day order only interact with the Highest Liquidity Profile, then any contra-side removal flow that is not from a Subscriber designated as Highest will not interact with the resting Day order. Liquidity removal orders may be blocked from interacting with resting orders based on the adding Subscriber's preferences. Liquidity removal orders cannot specify Liquidity Profile blocking. If a liquidity removal order includes a Liquidity Profile blocking<br>instruction, the order will still be accepted, but the blocking instruction will be ignored. Other than what has been described, no other order interaction is effected by the Liquidity Profile designation of a particular Subscriber.<br>Liquidity Profiles only apply to order interaction in the Main Session and have no influence on order interaction in the Conditional Session.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">
