Pursuant to SEC Rule 301(b)(10) and other regulatory requirements, Luminex has critical physical and logical access controls to reasonably ensure that access to Confidential Trading Information of Subscribers is appropriately restricted to only those who need such access to support the System. The controls and related restrictions apply to Luminex or Titan employees that support the System (collectively, "Technology and Operations Personnel"). With respect to physical access controls, Luminex offices are locked at all times and are inaccessible to the public at all times. Luminex maintains three offices: its corporate headquarters (the "Main Office") in Boston, Massachusetts which houses certain Luminex management and staff that support the LeveL ATS; a second Boston office (the "Luminex ATS office") which houses certain other Luminex management and staff that support the Luminex ATS; and, an office in Charleston, South Carolina (the "Charleston office") that houses Luminex employees in technical roles, including Technology and Operations Personnel that support both the Luminex ATS and the LeveL ATS.<br> Access to the Luminex office spaces is permitted for Luminex employees and a limited number of building management, building security, and other related staff. While Luminex management may have access to enter any Luminex office, Luminex employees that only support the Luminex ATS do not have access to the Main Office or the Charleston office.  Similarly, Luminex employees that only support the LeveL ATS do not have access to the Luminex ATS office where Luminex ATS-supporting employees work.  Physical access is controlled via enabled swipe cards, which must be approved by the Luminex Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or an approved delegate. The Luminex CISO regularly reviews reports to determine who accessed Luminex space to ensure that the documented access to Luminex office space was limited to authorized individuals and also regularly reviews the list of persons authorized to have access to the Firm's office space in order to reasonably ensure that only appropriate persons have access to the Firm's office space. The data center that supports the System is also equipped with multiple levels of security in order to reasonably ensure that access is limited to appropriately authorized individuals. It is important to note that even though a person may have physical access to Luminex office space, access to Confidential Trading Information is strictly controlled through the processes described immediately below.<br><br>Luminex uses a privileged access system as an access control with respect to Luminex systems, applications, and accounts and any Confidential Trading Information contained therein. Such information with respect to the Luminex ATS is maintained on separate servers and in separate databases from such information with respect to the LeveL ATS.  The privileged access system for the Luminex ATS is managed on the Firm's behalf by its information security vendor, Options-IT (formerly Fixnetix Ltd.).  Please see the Form ATS-N for the LeveL ATS for a description of the applicable controls and procedures for that system.<br> Options-IT enables and disables accounts for applicable Technology and Operations Personnel solely based upon instruction from the Luminex CISO or approved delegate. In addition, even those granted access can only access the information needed to perform their specific job functions. Access and entitlements are generally assigned to particular access groups, and thus access to Confidential Trading Information is limited to those groups that perform support functions that require access to systems that may contain Subscriber Confidential Trading Information. Please see Part II Item 7(d). Those not in such groups do not have access to Confidential Trading Information. Luminex performs a periodic review of all Technology and Operations Personnel with access to systems containing Confidential Trading Information to ensure that access to systems that may contain Subscriber Confidential Trading Information is strictly limited to only those Technology and Operations Personnel who need it in order to perform their job functions.  As described in Part II Item 6(a), certain Technology and Operations Personnel have access to Confidential Trading Information for both the Luminex ATS and the LeveL ATS.  Luminex policy prohibits personnel with access to Subscriber Confidential Trading Information from sharing such information with personnel not authorized to receive such information and from otherwise using such information for any purpose other than supporting the operations of the Luminex ATS or its compliance with applicable rules and regulations.  Specifically, Technology and Operations Personnel as well as Legal and Compliance staff are prohibited from using confidential trading information from the Luminex ATS in any way relating to their support and operations of the LeveL ATS.  Luminex policy prohibits Technology and Operations Personnel and Legal and Compliance staff from sharing Luminex ATS Subscriber Confidential Trading Information with other Luminex personnel or Nasdaq Personnel.<br><br>Luminex has engaged its cybersecurity vendor, Options-IT, to perform regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing assessments as part of the Firm's efforts to appropriately safeguard client Confidential Trading Information on the Luminex ATS. Among other protections, the Firm employs firewall and intrusion prevention and detection systems to further protect such Confidential Trading Information.<br><br>Luminex also utilizes several data loss prevention measures in an effort to reasonably ensure that Confidential Trading Information is not inappropriately taken from Luminex systems. These measures include the blocking of Luminex employee access to on-line file sharing sites (including, but not limited to, Dropbox and other similar sites) and the disabling of write capabilities of USB drives on Luminex PCs and laptops so that Confidential Trading Information may not be copied onto portable storage devices. The Luminex CISO may permit the temporary availability of a file sharing site to enable Luminex operations staff to provide a specific Subscriber with application-related files, after which the file sharing site is once again blocked from availability. The Firm blocks access to social media sites from web browsers on Firm PCs and laptops, and the Firm also blocks access to internet-based webmail programs. In addition, Luminex captures and monitors all employee electronic communications through Firm accounts to reasonably ensure that employees are not inappropriately transmitting Confidential Trading Information outside of the Firm via email, text message, or other means of Firm-provided electronic communication. Electronic communications via Firm accounts are regularly reviewed by Compliance and management to ensure compliance with Firm policies. Firm employees are regularly trained on appropriate treatment of Confidential Trading Information, and related policies and procedures are also contained in the Firm's Written Supervisory Procedures document, which is required to be read and attested to by all Firm employees twice annually.<br><br>In addition, Technology and Operations Personnel are subject to trading restrictions to ensure that such persons' trading activities do not conflict with the interests of System Subscribers. Luminex does not have any individual or retail customer accounts, including employee accounts. As such, Luminex employee trading accounts must be opened and maintained at other broker-dealers, upon approval by the Luminex Chief Compliance Officer (CCO). Luminex employees are required to disclose to Compliance all outside brokerage accounts, and duplicate trade confirmations and account statements are required to be provided to Compliance for all Luminex employee-related accounts held outside the Firm.  Luminex Compliance reviews all employee trade confirmations and account statements received for indications of potential misuse of Subscriber Confidential Trading Information.  Certain trading restrictions, such as Compliance pre-approvals and mandatory hold periods, are in place for less liquid securities (generally, non-large cap securities).  Exceptions to these restrictions must be approved in advance by Compliance, and the approval and hold period requirements do not apply to employee accounts which are managed by an advisor (human or automated) that has full investment discretion while the employee has none.

Confidential Trading Information is kept confidential (meaning, in this specific case, not disclosed outside the Firm to anyone who is not otherwise supporting the System) up until the time the transaction is cleared and settled, which involves NFS, Luminex's clearing firm for the Luminex ATS, and the other external parties referenced immediately above. For example, on trade date, a Subscriber will submit instructions electronically designating to which subaccount shares purchased or sold through the Subscriber's master trading account should be allocated, designating that specific share amounts from the block execution be settled in specific subaccounts (typically in the name of mutual funds or similar funds on whose behalf the Subscriber is purchasing or selling securities). Depending on the method of clearance and settlement, details of the share purchase or sale will be made available to NFS and to other entities involved in the clearance and settlement of the Subscriber's transaction. Please see Part III Item 22 below. Any other consents to the disclosure of its own Confidential Trading Information must be made in writing, including but not limited to email, to Luminex ATS Sales or other appropriate Luminex employees.<br><br>On a next day basis (meaning, on the trade date after the previous trade date), Luminex informs "opt-in" Subscribers of the securities that traded in the System on the prior trading day. In this context, "opt-in" means a Subscriber who wishes to receive these notifications, which are displayed in the Luminex UI. In exchange for being able to view these notifications in the Luminex UI, an "opt-in" Subscriber must be willing to allow the securities that they traded in the System to be included in the notifications. For example, if two "opt-in" Subscribers matched and executed a trade in the System in security "XYZ," then XYZ would be listed in the trade advertisement that is displayed to "opt-in" Subscribers the following trading day. If an "opt-in" Subscriber matched and executed a trade in the System with a "non-opt-in" Subscriber in XYZ, then XYZ would not be listed in the trade advertisement that is displayed to "opt-in" Subscribers the following trading day, unless there was a separate transaction in that same security involving two "opt-in" Subscribers. The parties associated with any trade in the System are not identified in any of these trade advertisements, nor are the specific terms and conditions of any transaction. The trade advertisements solely list the securities that traded in the System, provided that both parties to the transaction or transactions in that security were "opt-in" Subscribers. "Opt-in" participation in the trade advertising program is at the broader Subscriber level and not at the trader level. This means that if a Subscriber opts in to trade advertisements, then no trades by any of its traders could be excluded from the trade advertisements if an "opt-in" Subscriber was on the other side of that transaction.  As noted in Part II, Item 5, trade advertising (symbol only) from the current trade date ("T") is made available to all Subscribers via the Luminex UI unless a Subscriber opts out of receiving such advertising.  Subscribers may contact Luminex ATS Sales either via phone or electronically to opt out of this real-time advertising.  As with the next day trade advertising, for a symbol to be advertised via the real-time advertising on T, the System must have had an execution in that symbol on T between two opt-in Subscribers.  If a Subscriber opts out of receiving real-time trade advertising, then that Subscriber's trades are not included among those which may be subject to real-time trade advertising.<span>&nbsp;</span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

As described below, the information available on the Sales Dashboard includes, on a pre-match basis, the Subscriber and trader who entered an order or trading interest into the System, the price (for limit orders) and size of such order, and the time the order was entered. For all Sales Dashboard users other than the Luminex Operations team, on a pre-match basis the tickers or stock symbols associated with live orders or trading interest in the System are masked in order to protect the confidential nature of such information. Other terms and conditions of the order or trading interest available on the Sales Dashboard include the entered Top Quantity, the entered MinQ and AutoEx, if applicable, whether the order or trading interest was to buy, to sell, or sell short, the market capitalization segment of the security (Large Cap, Mid Cap, or Small Cap), which sector the security belongs to (e.g., Healthcare, Utilities, etc.), and various System individual security and aggregate trading statistics. A significant amount of the information available in the Sales Dashboard is not Confidential Trading Information but is instead non-Subscriber-specific or non-security-specific System data. Once a match occurs in the System, the real symbol relating to that match becomes available in order to allow the Luminex ATS Sales team to respond to trader inquiries with respect to the match, to contact traders who may have fallen down on a match (See Part III Item 13), and to provide similar post-match trader support functions. The Sales Dashboard also includes post-match information including the executed quantity and execution price for those matches that result in an execution in the System. The Luminex CCO, who supports both the Luminex ATS and the LeveL ATS, has similar access to post-match Subscriber information in order to respond to regulatory inquiries as necessary. Other Luminex staff that support the Luminex ATS have access to the Sales Dashboard for the purpose of monitoring the overall activity in the System. As described in Part II Item 7(a) above, all Luminex employees that support the System are subject to appropriate confidentiality commitments and to restrictive employee trading policies in order to reasonably protect Subscriber Confidential Trading Information from potential misuse.<span>&nbsp;</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div><a name="partIII"><h1>ATS-N/UA: Part III: Manner of Operations</h1></a><div class="form1"><br><a name="partIIIitem1"><h4>Item 1: <u>Types of ATS Subscribers</u></h4></a><table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td class="label">

				  </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The Luminex ATS is a buy-side (asset management) focused ATS.  In that regard, Luminex admits as Subscribers buy-side asset management institutions that trade NMS equity securities.  A typical profile of an asset management Luminex ATS Subscriber would include entities that trade NMS equity securities, often in block size, and that generally do not engage in short-term (such as intraday) trading in the same security.<br><br>Luminex also admits certain broker-dealers as Subscribers, as described below.  Luminex only admits as Subscribers broker-dealers who are either (i) trading on behalf of existing Luminex buy-side Subscribers ("sponsored access"), (ii) Transition Management brokers, (iii) Outsourced Trading brokers, or (iv) Broker-Dealer Routers.  For clarity, a broker-dealer Subscriber may access the ATS in multiple capacities (that is, for example, a Transition Management broker may also submit orders via a broker-dealer router).<br><br>Transition Management:  Luminex may admit as a Subscriber a broker-dealer that submits orders or trading interest relating to Transition Management services (the "Transition Management Brokers").  "Transition Management" generally refers to the process of an entity (such as a pension fund) "transitioning" from one investment manager to another, for example, which may require the liquidation of one portfolio of securities and the acquisition of another portfolio of securities.   These Transition Management Brokers must attest to Luminex upon becoming a Subscriber that any orders or trading interest entered into the System by the Transition Management Brokers represents orders or trading interest from Transition Management clients of those brokers and not from any other desk or business lines of those brokers.<br><br>Sponsored Access:  Luminex also admits broker-dealers as Subscribers that are designated by a Luminex buy-side Subscriber as a "sponsor" for orders or trading interest entered by the existing Luminex ATS buy-side Subscriber.  In such "sponsored access" cases, Luminex buy-side Subscribers can, via the Luminex ATS UI, select an admitted broker-dealer as their "sponsor" on an order-by-order basis and have any resulting transaction credited and cleared and settled via that selected broker-dealer.  Orders or trading interest relating to these sponsored access arrangements are entered by the Luminex buy-side Subscriber and such orders or trading interest are attributed to the Trader ID associated with the buy-side Subscriber's trader that entered such orders or trading interest for tiering (see Part III Item 13) or other applicable purposes.<br><br>Outsourced Trading:  In addition, Luminex admits as Subscribers broker-dealers that perform so-called "outsourced trading" services for other entities ("Outsourced Trading Brokers").  "Outsourced Trading" generally refers to the practice of investment entities retaining third parties to perform trading services on their behalf, often seeking to leverage the size and scale of the typically larger Outsourced Trading Brokers.<br><br>Broker-dealer Routers:  Admitted broker-dealers may also enter orders or trading interest to the Luminex ATS directly on behalf of either (i) existing Luminex ATS buy-side Subscribers or (ii) buy-side institutions that are not separately Luminex ATS Subscribers and who utilize the services of Outsourced Trading brokers.  All broker-dealer Subscribers who are entering orders or trading interest on behalf of buy-side institutions must agree to disclose to Luminex the underlying buy-side institution on all orders and trading interest submitted to the Luminex ATS (whether or not such buy-side institution is separately a Luminex ATS Subscriber.)<br><br>Any Nasdaq Entity is not eligible to become a Subscriber to the Luminex ATS.<br><br>Prospective Subscribers must comply with Firm and regulatory due diligence and account documentation requirements before being approved as a Subscriber.  For buy-side Subscribers, these due diligence requirements generally include the satisfactory completion of a written Subscriber Agreement, the submission of a U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-9 or equivalent, written Subscriber requests on preferences for the receipt of paper account statements (if applicable), a written Prime Brokerage Clearance Services Agreement (if applicable), the satisfactory completion of an Office of Foreign Asset Control ("OFAC") review, and other customer identification requirements such as the receipt and review of the Subscriber's Form ADV (if applicable) and verification of other information of the Subscriber, such as its authorized contact persons and authorized traders.  Prospective broker-dealer Subscribers must complete a new account form, provide all required supporting documentation (e.g., formation documents, Form BD), submit an account application listing key management and beneficial owners, and execute a Subscriber Agreement and any other relevant agreement applicable to the services provided to that client.<br><br>Luminex does not admit natural persons as Subscribers to the Luminex ATS.  Luminex, in its sole discretion, may restrict a prospective Subscriber from accessing the Luminex ATS due to legal, credit, or other concerns including, without limitation, a suspension or expulsion from an SRO, credit risk, existence of regulatory settlements, and negative news reports relating to the prospective Subscriber.<span>&nbsp;</span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

Please see Part III Item 13. The Firm, in its sole discretion, can exclude any Subscriber from the ATS services if, for example, the Subscriber begins to engage in short-term (such as intraday) trading on the platform.  A failure to meet financial or other due diligence requirements could also lead to a Subscriber being denied access to the ATS. A Subscriber may also be excluded from the ATS services if the Subscriber was accused of committing or was found to have committed regulatory violations that could pose regulatory or reputational risk to the Firm or to its other Subscribers, in the Firm's judgment. And if a Subscriber appears to be encountering financial difficulties (as evidenced by publicly available financial reports, via self-reporting by the Subscriber or via inquiry by the Firm, via a material drop in the Subscriber's AUM due to redemptions, or other factors as determined by the Firm), then that Subscriber may be excluded from the ATS services.  If a Subscriber that is a Transition Management Broker enters orders or trading interest into the System that does not represent order flow from Transition Management clients of that broker, the Transition Management Broker may be excluded from the ATS services.

				  </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">In addition to using an O/EMS to send orders or trading interest to the System, Subscribers may also use a third party technology provider or an admitted broker-dealer's smart order router as long as the orders or trading interest are sent to the System directly from or on behalf of the Luminex ATS buy-side client, meaning they are institutional customer orders or trading interest where the third party or broker-dealer routing system passes a client identifier for the underlying Subscriber and trader that sent the order or trading interest. The third party or broker-dealer routers are accessed via a front-end at the Subscriber, and any orders or trading interest sent to Luminex via such third party or broker-dealer routers are submitted to the System using FIX 4.2. Although the third party or broker-dealer routers are routed directly into the low-latency FIX gateway, while orders or trading interest submitted by O/EMSs are subject to additional processing upon submission prior to being submitted to the matching engine, there is no material latency difference between the third party or broker-dealer routers and other means of order and trading interest transmission via an OMS or EMS. As noted in Part III Item 7(a), time of order receipt is the third and least important factor in order priority, which lessens the importance of any routing latency difference that may exist between third party or broker-dealer routers and other means of order and trading interest submission.  Luminex may integrate with other technology providers at any time at its discretion or at the request of its Subscribers. Subscribers wishing to route orders or trading interest to the System via any unsupported third party technology providers or broker-dealer routers would have to work with Luminex and the new third party technology provider or broker-dealer to ensure that the new provider would pass to the System a client identifier for the underlying Subscriber and trader that sent the order or trading interest.<span>&nbsp;</span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

The entry of such a large number of active Conditionals at one time could prove cumbersome for a trader to manage. In order to more effectively manage their Conditionals, Subscribers are able to opt in to a feature through which Subscribers can define both a number of Conditionals that to them would qualify as a "basket" (the minimum is one Conditional and there is no maximum) and also define a "collection period" for their Conditionals to be held in the System (the minimum is one millisecond and there is no maximum) before either the Subscriber or the System releases the Conditionals for potential matching opportunities. Through this feature, which would have to be enabled by Luminex and programmed into the Subscriber's particular user interface/front end, if the number of Conditionals entered by the Subscriber during the Subscriber-defined collection period equals or exceeds the Subscriber-set number that would define a basket for that Subscriber, the Conditionals will pend and will require the Subscriber to manually release the Conditionals into the System. If the number of Conditionals entered by the Subscriber during that collection period is less than the number that would be a basket for that Subscriber, the Conditionals will automatically go into the System and will become "live" active Conditionals. In either case, the Conditionals will pend during the Subscriber-specified collection period before being either manually or automatically released into the System.

The minimum AutoEx Quantity is the System minimum trade size of 5,000 shares. A "Firm Order" is a fully executable order that can execute in full at the entered AutoEx Quantity upon a match in the System if the contra side order is another Firm Order or if the contra side Subscriber firms up on a Conditional.<br> For Firm Orders, Subscribers may specify a minimum quantity at which they are willing to trade ("MinQ") on an order-by-order basis, which must be equal or greater than 5,000 shares. For Firm Orders, MinQ specifies the minimum AutoEx Quantity with which a Subscriber will interact and does not allow for the aggregation of contra-side orders to satisfy an order's MinQ requirement. For example, an order with a MinQ of 21,000 shares would not interact with three 7,000 share Firm Orders. An order's MinQ cannot exceed the order's AutoEx Quantity. All unexecuted orders may be cancelled prior to matching (as discussed below) by timely submission to the System of cancellation instructions.<br><br>Conditionals - A "Conditional" is a representation of potential trading interest by a Subscriber in a particular security. Upon a match in the System, an invitation is sent to a Subscriber that entered a Conditional subject to a match for that Subscriber to "firm-up" the Conditional with a specific share amount at which the Subscriber would be willing to trade. Subscribers who enter Conditionals are presented with the opportunity to trade but not an obligation to do so, as such Subscribers may either actively decline the invitation or allow the invitation to "time out" following the end of the Negotiation Period as defined herein. The minimum trade size for Conditionals is also 5,000 shares, and there is no maximum quantity, although each order is bound by applicable pre-trade Market Access limits established by Luminex pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3-5 (the "Market Access Rule"). Such limits in this specific case include overall share size limits in relation to a security's average daily volume, total order notional size limits (meaning, the share volume of the order multiplied by the current price of the security), and the notional size of the order in relation to the Subscriber's overall gross notional limit set by the Firm for each Subscriber. There is no AutoEx for Conditionals. Subscribers that enter a Conditional may also enter a MinQ, which specifies the minimum size of a contra-side order with which the Conditional would be willing to potentially trade. The MinQ for Conditionals must be greater than 5,000 shares. A Subscriber who enters a Conditional with a MinQ will not be presented with invitations to trade against contra-side orders with a Top Quantity that is less than the MinQ of the Conditional. If a Subscriber enters a MinQ on a Conditional and elects to firm-up (as explained below), the Subscriber must firm-up for at least the MinQ amount. Potential information leakage could occur if a Subscriber enters a Conditional with a very large MinQ to probe whether there is an equally large order or Conditional on the contra side to potentially match against. If that large Conditional matches a similarly sized contra side order or Conditional, the Subscriber entering the Conditional (as described below) could decline a match and thus learn of large trading interest by another Subscriber without having had to effect a transaction in the System. In order to reasonably prevent such information leakage, the System caps the maximum size for the MinQ for Firm Orders and Conditionals. The maximum MinQ is set at 25,000 shares. Any change to the maximum MinQ will be disclosed in writing to Subscribers in advance of such change. For a Conditional, the entire quantity entered by the Subscriber is conditional, which gives the Subscriber the option, but not the obligation, to trade following a match of eligible orders or trading interest and the receipt of an invitation to trade. As described more fully below, a Subscriber who enters a Conditional may still decline an invitation to trade even if the contra side order's Top Quantity exceeds the MinQ of the Conditional.<br><br>Subscribers entering Conditionals may use limit prices, entered either via the Subscriber's OMS, EMS, or third-party or broker-dealer router or via the Luminex UI after the Conditional has been entered by the Subscriber on the Luminex ATS.  Upon a match, the System will recall the entered limit price and route that limit price with the Subscriber's firm-up (if any) to the Luminex ATS.  Any limit price entered by the Subscriber via the Luminex UI cannot violate a limit that the Subscriber entered for that Conditional via its OMS, EMS, or third-party or broker-dealer router.<br><br>Order Types - All orders or trading interest entered into the System are pegged, for order matching purposes, to the midpoint of the national best bid or offer ("NBBO") with the reference price calculation excluding (i) any manual quotations that have crossed the market and (ii) the quotations of any automated trading center with respect to which the Firm has declared self-help. A Subscriber may designate a limit price for each order or Conditional. Orders and Conditionals may only have a time-in-force of Day. All orders are either executed in the System or cancelled.<br><br>LeveLUp - All Luminex ATS Subscribers can elect or "opt in" to a service called "LeveLUp" that would allow the Subscriber to be able to direct that orders (in whole or in part) be routed by Luminex, as broker-dealer operator, from the Luminex ATS to the LeveL ATS.  The handling of such routed orders will be governed by the rules and policies of the LeveL ATS once the order is entered into the LeveL ATS.  While the LeveL ATS makes all of its features available to all LeveL ATS Subscribers, not all LeveL ATS features will be available to Luminex ATS Subscribers.  Please see the LeveL ATS Form ATS-N for a full description of all LeveL ATS rules and policies.  What follows is a description of the features and order parameters of the LeveL ATS that Luminex will offer to Luminex ATS Subscribers that opt in to the LeveLUp feature.<br><br>Luminex will offer LeveLUp participants two potential counterparty groups once the opt-in Luminex Subscriber orders reach the LeveL ATS: "BD/Agency Algo/Smart Order Router" order flow, or that segment as well as external market makers.  Luminex Subscribers will also be able to request to interact with or not interact with specific LeveL ATS counterparties by submitting requests in writing to the Luminex ATS Sales team.  While the LeveL ATS accepts Day, "Good Til Time," and "Immediate or Cancel" orders, Luminex will only support Day orders for LeveLUp during the initial roll-out of the service.<br><br>Conditionals or Firm Orders can be used by Luminex ATS Subscribers as part of the LeveLUp functionality.  Subscribers can set system parameters such that all of their Firm Orders or Conditionals sent to Luminex would be immediately routed in full as Firm Orders (all orders sent by Luminex as broker-dealer operator to the LeveL ATS are Firm Orders) to the LeveL ATS without interacting with the Luminex ATS, be routed to the LeveL ATS after resting first at Luminex (Conditionals only) for a configurable time period if the order does not receive an execution on the Luminex ATS, or be routed to the LeveL ATS following a partial execution at the Luminex ATS.  Subscribers may also select orders for routing to the LeveL ATS on an order-by-order basis, the parameters for which are all determined by the Subscriber on each order.  This functionality involves the routing of a Firm Order to the LeveL ATS with certain criteria selected by the Subscriber.  If the Subscriber chooses to have their Conditionals rest on the Luminex ATS before being routed by Luminex to the LeveL ATS, the Subscriber can set a "LeveLUp Wait Time," which is the amount of time that a Conditional will rest at the Luminex ATS before a Firm Order will be sent by Luminex to the LeveL ATS.  Subscribers can also set a share amount or a quantity percentage amount of their Firm Order or Conditional to be routed to the LeveL ATS.  Luminex will select the lesser of the two quantities if both are selected.  Subscribers can select a minimum required quantity for executions of their orders on the LeveL ATS, can set a limit, select a LeveL ATS order type (primary peg, midpoint peg, or market peg), and a "reload after completion" time which is a configurable period of time after a Subscriber execution on the LeveL ATS before the system will request more shares from the Subscriber's resting Firm Order or Conditional on the Luminex ATS (if any) to be routed to the LeveL ATS.  If at least 5,000 shares remain resting at the Luminex ATS relating to an order routed to the LeveL ATS, Subscribers who receive a match on the resting shares at the Luminex ATS will have the ability to firm up for the total unexecuted quantities at both venues relating to that Subscriber's original Firm Order or Conditional.  If the leaves quantity on a LeveLUp order following an execution is less than the Subscriber's entered minimum quantity, the Subscriber's minimum quantity will be reduced to match the leaves quantity.<br><br>Subscribers may cancel their LeveLUp orders via their OMS, EMS, or router or via the Luminex UI.  Luminex would only cancel the Subscriber's order that had been routed to the LeveL ATS if required to do so, either because the Subscriber wishes to include the shares in a firm-up on the Luminex ATS or if the Subscriber's OMS or EMS requires it.  All functionality must be requested by an Authorized Contact at the Subscriber to the Luminex ATS Sales department.<br><br>Luminex, in its capacity as a broker-dealer and the broker-dealer operator of the Luminex ATS, is the Subscriber to the LeveL ATS for the purposes of LeveLUp and the Luminex ATS Subscriber is not.  At the LeveL ATS, LeveLUp orders must be Firm Orders and not Conditionals.  LeveLUp orders intended to rest first on the Luminex ATS must be for 5,000 shares or more, the Luminex ATS minimum order size.  (See Part III Item 8 below.)  If a Subscriber opts in for this functionality, LeveLUp orders intended to be routed directly through Luminex to the LeveL ATS can be for less than 5,000 shares and must comply with the LeveL order size requirements.  If a Luminex ATS Subscriber receives a LeveLUp-related execution in the Luminex ATS which leaves less than 5,000 shares on the Subscriber's order, Luminex can still route that order to the LeveL ATS even though it is for less than the Luminex ATS system minimum.  Luminex ATS Subscribers interested in this "clean-up" functionality are required to elect to enable this feature and the Luminex ATS Subscriber's OMS or EMS must be configured to re-send orders or trading interest to the Luminex ATS if the quantity falls below the Luminex ATS minimum order size of 5,000 shares.  In addition, so long as a LeveLUp participant has a Conditional of 5,000 shares or more resting on the Luminex ATS in addition to an order routed through to the LeveL ATS, that Subscriber will be able to size up on a match at the Luminex ATS to the total shares represented for that Subscriber in both venues.<br><br>This LeveLUp order routing arrangement is not reciprocal; the LeveL ATS cannot route orders from its customers to the Luminex ATS.  The use or non-use of LeveLUp itself by any Luminex ATS Subscriber has no impact on the order priority or execution logic within the Luminex ATS.  There are certain cases where certain LeveLUp activity could impact related order priority within the Luminex ATS.  For example, a Luminex ATS Subscriber may, prior to Luminex sending a Firm LeveLUp order, reduce the quantity of a parent Conditional with the Luminex ATS by the intended quantity of the Firm LeveLUp order via cancel/replace functionality.  In that case, the new "replace" Conditional on the Luminex ATS would have a new lower priority rank than the original Conditional.  Similarly, if a Subscriber cancels a Firm Order that had been routed by Luminex to the LeveL ATS and cancel/replaces the original Conditional on the Luminex ATS back to its original quantity, that new "replace" Conditional on the Luminex ATS would also have a new lower priority rank than the original Conditional.  This rank adjustment occurs with cancel/replace functionality whether the Luminex ATS Subscriber uses LeveLUp or not.  LeveLUp-related execution reports are sent from the LeveL ATS back to Luminex for clearance and settlement pursuant to normal Luminex processes.<br><br>Modifications - Firm Orders may be modified while resting on the System via cancel/replace, but not during the Negotiation Period, as defined below.  For Conditionals that receive a match, the System allows the Subscriber to firm up the same shares as, more shares than, or fewer shares than the original Conditional submission at the Subscriber's option.  Subscribers that use the Luminex UI can only increase the quantity up to the maximum quantity associated with the Conditional.  Subscribers that do not use the Luminex UI and access the System via other means such as third-party or broker-dealer routers are able to respond to invitations up to whatever quantity they have available in the front end that they use, regardless of the original quantity that was entered on the Conditional.  The Conditional quantity may only be reduced below the System minimum of 5,000 shares if the Subscriber has opted in to the "clean-up" feature of LeveLUp, as described below, but may not be reduced below 5,000 shares during the Negotiation Period.  For these "opt-in" Subscribers, such below-5,000 share modifications will be routed to the LeveL ATS for handling.  For all other Subscribers, reducing the share quantity to less than the 5,000 share System minimum (or the Subscriber's selected MinQ) will result in a rejection.  In addition, if a Conditional is entered with a limit, that limit price may be modified following a match.<br><br>Order Priority - Assuming orders and trading interest are marketable, the System prioritizes orders and trading interest based on the following factors, in the following order: (1) the higher AutoEx Quantity (between two Firm Orders), (2) Firm Orders over Conditionals, (3)Top Quantity (between two Conditionals), and (4) time of order entry or entry of the trading interest. Orders or Conditionals that are subject to a cancel/replace lose their priority in the System, with the "replace" being treated as a new order or Conditional for prioritization purposes. The functionality for Subscribers' traders to enter Firm Orders is enabled in all OMS/EMS or routers that are integrated with/connected to the System. The functionality for Conditionals has been made available to all Subscribers but not all Subscribers use the Conditional functionality.

The minimum trade size for a Conditionals is also 5,000 shares, and there is no maximum quantity, although each order is bound by applicable pre-trade limits established by Luminex pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3-5. There is no AutoEx for Conditionals. Subscribers that enter a Conditional may also enter a MinQ, which specifies the minimum size of a contra-side order against which the Conditional could potentially trade. The MinQ for Conditionals must be greater than 5,000 shares. A Subscriber who enters a Conditional with a MinQ will not be presented with invitations to trade against contra-side orders with a Top Quantity that is less than the MinQ of the Conditional. If a Subscriber enters a MinQ on a Conditional and elects to "firm-up," the Subscriber must firm-up for at least the MinQ amount. Potential information leakage could occur if a Subscriber enters a Conditional with a very large MinQ to probe whether there is an equally large order on the contra side to potentially match against. If that large Conditional matches a similarly sized contra-side order, the Subscriber entering the Conditional (as described below) could decline a match and thus learn of large trading interest by another Subscriber without having had to effect a transaction in the System. In order to reasonably prevent such information leakage, the System caps the maximum order size for the MinQ for Firm Orders and Conditionals. The maximum MinQ is set at 25,000. Any change to the maximum MinQ will be disclosed in writing to Subscribers in advance of such change. For a Conditional, the entire quantity entered by the Subscriber is conditional, which gives the Subscriber the option, but not the obligation, to trade following a match of eligible orders or trading interest and the receipt of an invitation to trade. As described more fully below, a Subscriber who enters a Conditional may still decline an invitation to trade even if the contra-side order's Top Quantity exceeds the MinQ of the Conditional.<br><br>There are no differences in how Conditionals are entered versus Firm Orders except for the requirement to enter an AutoEx quantity for a Firm Order, which is not applicable to Conditionals. Conditionals may be submitted via the Subscriber's OMS or EMS (whether a vendor system or a proprietary OMS or EMS) or via a third party service provider or broker-dealer router. Upon a match with a potential contra-side order (which could be Conditional or Firm Order), an invitation to firm up the Conditional is sent to the Subscriber who entered the Conditional. The trader who entered the Conditional has the ability to either decline the opportunity to trade, to firm up the Conditional for some quantity limited to the Top Quantity entered with the Conditional, or allow the invitation to expire. To firm up following an invitation to trade, a trader specifies the amount of shares that the trader is willing to trade relating to that specific match. No additional terms or conditions are entered in a firm-up. In addition, no information about the potential contra-side order or trading interest is provided other than the fact that one exists. Potential order and trading interest interaction scenarios are described in the response to Part III Item 11(c) and examples are also outlined in the attachment relating to Part III Item 11(c).

There are no order type restrictions following a stoppage of trading in a security during regular trading hours.<br><br>Order Interaction - It is possible for any of the supported order or trading interest types - Firm Orders and Conditionals - to interact with each other, as described more fully in the attached chart. In the scenarios described in the chart, the actions of the buyer who enters a particular order or trading interest type with various characteristics are mapped against the seller who enters a particular order or trading interest type with various characteristics. The scenarios assume both sides are marketable and show what the result would be if the buyer and seller took particular actions. A helpful way to read the chart, for each scenario, is, "Assume the buyer entered an order or trading interest of this type, for this size, at this price, and matched against a seller who entered an order or trading interest of this type, for this size, and at this price. If the buyer and/or seller responded to the match in this way or these ways, here is the expected result." Where at least one side of a match is  a Conditional, an invitation to trade is sent to that Subscriber (a "Firm-Up Request").  Note that "SSR" in the chart refers to short sale restriction. (Please see the Order Interaction during an Exchange Act Rule 201 Short Sale "Circuit Breaker" below.)<br><br>Auto Execution - Where there are two marketable orders in the same security on opposite sides, the orders will match. Firm Orders that match will execute immediately at the midpoint of the National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO) at the time of the match, with the execution size being the smaller of the two orders' AutoEx Quantities ("Auto Execution"). A Firm Order can match and execute against another Firm Order until 15:59:59.<br><br>Negotiation - Firm-Ups - In the absence of an Auto Execution, orders can enter negotiation after matches that include a Conditional. Subscribers that enter Conditionals and receive a match are sent Firm-Up Requests. For matches that occur in the System up until 15:59:37, Subscribers that receive invitations to negotiate are given 20 seconds in which to determine whether, and for what quantity, to firm-up. The Subscriber(s) will be given the option to firm-up to their Top Quantity, regardless of the contra-side's Top Quantity. A Conditional's Firm-Up Quantity equals the number of shares, if any, of the Conditional s Top Quantity that the Subscriber elects to make available for execution in response to a Firm-Up Request. As noted, where a Conditional has a MinQ, a Subscriber may not firm-up for an amount less than the Conditional's MinQ. Upon an invitation to size-up or firm-up, a trader solely enters a share quantity and no other terms or conditions. Once submitted, a Firm-Up Quantity cannot be modified or cancelled. During the Negotiation Period, which is the time period that a Subscriber has to determine whether to firm-up, the Subscriber's order cannot match with another order. Additionally, neither party may cancel or modify its order once the initial match has occurred and the parties are in negotiation. Any cancellation requests will pend or queue in the System and will be processed once the negotiation has concluded. Execution size is determined upon the earlier of (a) the last required Subscriber's election to firm-up, or (b) 20 seconds from the time of the initial match (i.e., the Negotiation Period for all trades other than at the very end of the trading day). The size of the execution will be (1) in the event only one Subscriber was asked to firm-up, the lesser of that order's Firm-Up Quantity and the AutoEx Quantity of the contra-side order and (2) in the event both Subscribers are asked to firm-up, the smaller of the Firm-Up Quantity elected. Execution price will be based on a decaying weighted average of the midpoints of the NBBO (based upon the Securities Information Processor ("SIP") feed for such security) observed each second of the Negotiation Period, starting at the time of the initial match, plus the two seconds immediately thereafter, where each midpoint price receives half the weight of the prior midpoint price (the "Derived Price"). The Derived Price will be rounded to the nearest halfpenny, subject to any constraints associated with an order's terms and conditions. In the event the Derived Price is worse than a Subscriber's limit price (the Exceeded Limit Price), the match between a Firm Order and another Firm Order will be limited to the lesser of the two orders' AutoEx Quantities at the Exceeded Limit Price. If one party to a match had entered a Conditional, or if both parties to a match had entered a Conditional, then an execution would not occur in the System if either party's limit price would be breached by the Derived Price of a transaction. See Part III Item 8(e) above for Mixed Lot Processing.<br><br>Auto Firm-Up - Subscribers have the ability to enter a quantity in the Luminex UI up to the Top Quantity of an existing Subscriber order which will instruct the System, upon a match, to automatically firm up that Subscriber's order via this Auto Firm-Up (AFU) feature.  In the event of one or more partial fills (executions for less than the Top Quantity), the AFU quantity will be decremented by each execution amount until the remaining order size is less than 5,000 shares, the System minimum order size.  At such time, the AFU election will be dropped or disabled.  If there is an execution for the full AFU quantity, subsequent matches would operate via the standard (non-AFU) Luminex ATS rules.  Orders using AFU are required to have a limit price, either entered via FIX message to the Luminex ATS or entered by the Subscriber manually via the Luminex UI.<br><br>Order Interaction during an Exchange Act Rule 201 Short Sale "Circuit Breaker" - When an Exchange declares a short sale "circuit breaker" pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 201, trading centers, with limited exceptions, are prohibited from executing short sales at a price that is equal to or below the national best bid. The "circuit breaker" restrictions generally remain in place on the day the "circuit breaker" is declared and for the entire following trading day. As noted, where both the seller and buyer have entered marketable Firm Orders and match, the System will immediately execute the transaction at the NBBO midpoint, as discussed herein. During a Rule 201 "circuit breaker," if the seller has entered a Firm Order or a Conditional to sell short that matches against a Conditional, the System may execute that order if the Derived Price of the transaction following the Negotiation Period is determined to be above the national best bid, in conformance with SEC Rule 201. If the Derived Price is determined to be at or below the national best bid, there will be no execution. Similarly, in these scenarios, the System will also check the Derived Price against the seller's limit price (if any), and if the Derived Price would violate the seller's limit price, there will be no execution.<br><br>End of Session Order Interaction - The order interaction protocols described above apply until 15:59:37. Until this time, negotiations can last for up to twenty seconds, and executions occur approximately two seconds following the conclusion of the negotiation. Because the System requires approximately two seconds to effect trades following a negotiation, the System requires that all negotiations end by 15:59:57. Between 15:59:37 and 15:59:57, the System will permit Negotiation Periods of less than twenty seconds, the duration of which will be the maximum amount of time remaining in the trading day up to 15:59:57. The shortest permissible Negotiation Period during this window is three seconds. For example, if a match occurs at 15:59:40, negotiations may continue for up to seventeen seconds (i.e., the maximum amount of time remaining until 15:59:57). Similarly, if a match occurs at 15:59:50, negotiations may continue for up to seven seconds (i.e., the maximum amount of time remaining until 15:59:57). If a match occurs at 15:59:54, negotiations may continue for up to three seconds (i.e., the maximum amount of time remaining until 15:59:57). Orders may not enter into a negotiation after 15:59:54. Conditionals that do not receive a match by 15:59:54 or that are received by the System after 15:59:54 cannot execute before the close of trading. The truncated Negotiation Periods near the close of trading allow Subscribers the opportunity to execute transactions that might not otherwise be possible if the System only permitted a Negotiation Period of twenty seconds. In the event of a shortened trading day, such as a holiday, the same protocols would apply during the last 23 seconds of the shortened trading day.<br><br>Multiple buyers and sellers are not permitted in the same execution, and thus allocation does not apply in this context. Luminex considers the results of its pricing calculation to be price improvement for both buyer and seller given that it is either the midpoint of the NBBO or at a price derived from a series of NBBO midpoints as described above.<br><br>Errors or Accommodations - In the event of a System error, such as an execution at a price based upon outdated or erroneous market data, Luminex would contact the Subscriber who may have been disadvantaged through the error to ask if the Subscriber wishes to have its execution priced at the corrected price as determined by the Firm using updated market data. If the Subscriber states, either orally or in writing, that it wishes to have the corrected execution price, Luminex would adjust the price on that Subscriber's execution, assuming the money difference in the Firm's Error account. If the disadvantaged Subscriber determines and notifies the Firm orally or in writing that it does not want the erroneous execution at all, even if adjusted to the correct price, and the contra-side to the execution did not want to bust the trade, then the Firm would assume the Subscriber position resulting from error and would trade out of that position outside of the ATS by sending an order to its clearing firm for handling and execution. The Firm does not execute any principal orders in the System. The Firm also may, in limited circumstances and in its sole discretion, grant accommodations to Subscribers due to unusual execution scenarios that impact a Subscriber but are not the result of a System error. For example, a Subscriber may receive an execution in the System in a mixed lot and may prefer an execution in a round lot. In such a case, if requested by a Subscriber orally or in writing, the Firm may elect to fill the remaining shares that would create a round lot execution for the Subscriber. The Firm would price those remaining shares at the same price as the mixed lot execution in the System, and the Firm would send an order to its clearing firm for handling and execution to cover the shares needed to fill the odd lot portion of the Subscriber order. The Firm maintains separate Error and Facilitation accounts for handling these respective scenarios.<br><br>The System time stamps all phases of the order and trading interest life cycle and does so in nanoseconds.<span>&nbsp;</span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

				  </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">Since implementation of Conditional functionality, Luminex has been educating Subscribers and their traders on its expectations regarding how traders should conduct their trading on the ATS (e.g., discouraging fall downs, which occur when a trader is presented with a match and either actively declines the opportunity to trade or allows the invitation to timeout without accepting the opportunity to trade). The Firm appreciates that there are legitimate reasons why a trader would fall down or decline the opportunity to trade when presented with a match on any venue. For example, the trader may have previously traded that same NMS stock on another venue and he or she may perhaps no longer be interested in buying or selling more of that stock. Or, perhaps the price of the security in question moved in a direction that makes purchasing or selling the security less optimal for the trader. However, repeated patterns of falling down in response to numerous trading invitations can cause frustration and negative experiences for those with the contra side of those matches. Thus, the Firm monitors and polices fall downs in order to try to keep fall downs to a minimum and thus improve the trading experience for all Subscribers.<br><br>In order to encourage the preferred manner of trading for which Luminex was designed and that its Subscribers expect, Luminex offers traders that have exhibited the most beneficial trading patterns (e.g., traders who consistently firm-up Conditionals or who enter Firm Orders) the ability to avoid trading with traders that exhibit the least beneficial trading patterns (e.g., traders who frequently fall down when presented with matching opportunities). Luminex accomplishes this by tiering its Subscribers' traders based on those traders' individual trading activities. The Firm's analysis of traders' trading behaviors (as indicated by fall down rates for Conditionals and by the entry of Firm Orders) focuses on activity at the individual Trader ID level, as a Subscriber may have multiple traders each with separate access (and perhaps multiple access points) to the ATS under a distinct Trader ID.<br><br>The Firm's tiering system consists of three tiers: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Tier 1 consists of traders who firm up 66% or more of the time on potential matches presented to them. And because Firm Orders contain a committed portion of that order that will trade upon consummation of a match, with no option to decline to trade, each entered Firm Order is the equivalent of a firm-up on a Conditional for the purposes of assessing trader behavior in the pool because these order types represents a willingness to trade upon a match in the System. Tier 3 consists of traders who firm up less than 33% of the time on potential matches presented to them. Tier 2 consists of all other traders.<br><br>Traders in Tier 1 are able, at their election, to avoid potential matches with traders in Tier 3. Traders may make this election at any time, including when they are in Tier 2 or Tier 3. However, the election will only become effective once the trader achieves a Tier 1 status. Traders may reverse that election at any time by notifying the Firm, and Luminex will implement that change as soon as practicable. The Firm has provided notice to all Subscribers and traders of relevant details regarding the tiering program (e.g., the criteria used to determine and move between tiers) prior to the implementation of the tiering program and will continue to provide notice in advance of any changes to the tiering program. Subscribers and traders may elect to receive notice of any changes to the placement of a Subscriber's traders in a tier that would impact their matching opportunities.<br><br>Tier calculations are performed weekly as of the close of business each Friday (or Thursday, in the event of a Friday market holiday). The calculation is based upon a week's worth of matches, with a minimum of twenty matches. If there are fewer than twenty matches for the week, the Firm will look back for the last twenty matches in the last (rolling) three months (meaning, the three prior consecutive calendar months preceding that weeks analysis date). In the event there are not twenty matches in the last (rolling) three months, the Firm will evaluate as many matches as possible but no fewer than ten matches. Any trader with fewer than ten matches will be in Tier 2. Tier placements are effective on the first trading day of the following week (Mondays, unless a particular Monday is a market holiday, in which case the tier placements would be effective on the Tuesday after the analysis is conducted).<br><br>Tier 1 "Opt-In" traders will match with all traders except those in Tier 3. Tier 2 traders and "non-Opt-In" traders in Tier 1 will match with all traders. Tier 3 traders will match with all traders except the Tier 1 "Opt-In" traders.<br><br>For traders with more than one method of entering orders onto the System (e.g., third party OMS/EMS or third party service bureau or broker-dealer router - see Part III, Item 5), that trader's trading behavior on each method is judged independently of the other for tier calculation purposes. Thus, if Trader A's activity via an OMS qualified Trader A for Tier 1 status but Trader A's activity via a service bureau router was deemed to be of Tier 3 status, Trader A could "opt-in" to avoid matches with Tier 3 traders, but that election would only apply to the potential matches that resulted from Trader A's use of his or her OMS and not to any potential matches that resulted from Trader A's use of the service bureau router. Similarly, if Trader B was in Tier 1 and opted in to avoid matching against Tier 3 traders, that Trader B could be presented with potential matches against orders entered by Trader A's OMS but would not be presented with matches against orders entered by Trader A's service bureau router.<br><br>The Firm has no requirement that any trader or set percentage of traders be in any particular tier. Consequently, it is possible that if there are no traders exhibiting less beneficial trading practices, there would be no traders in Tier 3. All new traders will begin in Tier 2. While there is no "appeal" process with respect to a trader's tier placement, Luminex retains the right to assign a Subscriber's traders to a different tier if in the Firm's judgment that tier is more appropriate based on factors such as those traders' broader histories on the Luminex platform.<span>&nbsp;</span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

	                   a. Identify and describe any fees or charges for use of the NMS Stock ATS services, including the type of fees (<u>e.g.,</u> subscription, connectivity), the structure of the fees (<u>e.g.,</u> fixed, volume-based, transaction-based), variables that impact the fees (<u>e.g.,</u> types of securities traded, block orders, form of connectivity to the ATS), differentiation among types of Subscribers (<u>e.g.,</u> broker-dealers, institutional investors, retail) and range of fees (<u>e.g.,</u> high and low).
	              </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">Luminex's base execution rate is 50 mills ($0.005) per executed share. Nearly all active Subscribers (those who regularly submit orders or trading interest to the ATS) pay the base execution rate, although execution rates are negotiated between Luminex and the relevant Subscriber and may be impacted by a number of factors, including connectivity or integration costs and the type of order flow from the particular Subscriber (i.e., Subscribers with more automated or electronic order flow and/or lower connectivity costs may pay a lower rate than Subscribers with less automated order flow or higher connectivity costs). The lowest rate for any Subscriber is 25 mills ($0.0025) per executed share. The highest rate for any Subscriber is 160 mills ($0.016) per executed share. Certain Subscribers pay commissions in "basis points," ranging from a low of one (1) basis point to a high of four (4) basis points. Each basis point equates to one hundredth of one percent of the notional value of the transaction. Depending on the provider, Luminex may "pass through" certain fees that it is charged by certain service bureau routers or OMS and EMS entities. These pass-through fees are fully disclosed to the applicable Subscribers and typically range from a high of 15 mills ($0.0015) to a low of zero mills per executed share. In certain instances, these vendors may charge Luminex more than 15 mills and thus a pass through fee charged to a Subscriber that uses that router, OMS, or EMS may exceed 15 mills.  In some cases, Subscribers may elect to pay a rate higher than the base execution rate, and they can also apply additional commission as part of a Commission Sharing Arrangement ("CSA") in conformance with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This amount above the base commission rate to be attributed to the CSA program is determined solely by the Subscriber, pursuant to a written agreement with Luminex.<br><br>The fees paid by Luminex ATS Subscribers for orders executed via LeveLUp, as described in Part III Item 7(a), will be the same that such Subscribers pay for executions on the Luminex ATS.  Luminex will pay a fee of 5 mills per executed share to the LeveL ATS for facilitating transactions involving orders routed to it via LeveLUp.<span>&nbsp;</span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

Any open negotiations involving any order types will be cancelled, and any orders in the relevant securities will be cancelled and returned to the entering Subscriber. Such orders or trading interest would need to be re-entered by the Subscriber following the resumption of trading in the respective securities. Please see Part III Item 11. The System ceases executing orders at 4:00 p.m. or such earlier time designated by the New York Stock Exchange in the event of an early close. Additionally, the System may not accept orders or trading interest if there are system issues or market disruptions that warrant a cessation of trading. The System also halts trading pursuant to regulatory halts declared by U.S. national securities exchanges, FINRA, and, if applicable, the SEC.<br><br>As noted in Part II Item 6(b), the System's primary servers are located in the NY4 data center in Secaucus, NJ.  The System has intrasite redundancy on separate servers in NY4 in the event the System's primary servers become unavailable.  In the event that the primary and back-up servers become unavailable, the System will suspend trading and cease operations until such time as its servers resume normal functionality.<br><br>Pursuant to SEC Rule 301(b)(5), an ATS is required to comply with the Fair Access requirements of SEC Rule 301(b)(5)(ii) if the ATS achieves certain trading thresholds in any individual NMS stock during at least four of the preceding six calendar months. Although it is likely that Luminex would not be required to comply with those Fair Access requirements in any event in light of factors referenced in SEC Rule 301(b)(5)(iii), even if it met the four out of six months trading threshold, Luminex nevertheless will cease accepting orders or trading interest in any NMS stock for at least one calendar month and thus would not permit or facilitate any executions in any such stock for that time period in the event the ATS met the referenced trading thresholds in that stock in three of the preceding five months. Once this period of time elapses that would prevent Luminex from meeting the four out of six months trading threshold, Luminex will resume allowing orders or trading interest to be submitted to the ATS in that NMS stock and would permit executions in that NMS stock pursuant to the executions methodologies described herein.<span>&nbsp;</span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

All transactions executed on the System except for sponsored access- and broker-dealer-router-related transactions are cleared and settled via NSCC and DTC by NFS pursuant to a fully-disclosed clearing arrangement between Luminex and NFS. A Luminex ATS buy-side Subscriber settles a transaction in the System against Luminex via its clearing firm (NFS) and not against the other Subscriber that is a party to the match. The identity of one party to a transaction in the System is never identified to the other side of that transaction in the System. Upon instructions received from a buy-side Subscriber, transactions in the System may also be cleared and settled via prime brokerage arrangements, via the Subscriber's custody bank, or via other settlement instructions provided to the Firm by the Subscriber.<br><br>All transactions involving sponsored access broker-dealers or relating to broker-dealer-routed orders (that is, all broker-dealer-related transactions that are not Transition Management or Outsourced Trading-related transactions) clear and settle in the following manner.  For such broker-dealers that clear through NFS, such transactions are cleared and settled via NSCC and DTC by NFS.  For such broker-dealers that do not clear through NFS, transactions involving such broker-dealers are submitted on behalf of both Luminex and the broker-dealer to NSCC via an NSCC QSR (Qualified Service Representative) Agreement or a Nasdaq AGU (Automated Confirmation Transaction (ACT) Give Up) Agreement.<span>&nbsp;</span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

	              </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The Firm receives the SIP market data feed from Options-IT, a vendor that handles market data feeds from various market data providers. The System uses the market data (NBBO and last sale price data) to provide pricing data to its Subscribers that use the Luminex UI as described above, and the System also uses the market data to determine the NBBO as it determines the execution price with respect to transactions on the System. In addition, the System also uses the market data to determine whether the resulting execution price is within or outside of the NBBO at the time of execution. As noted above, the System does not prioritize orders based on price, nor does it display orders or trading interest to parties inside or outside of the ATS. Price-related market data is also used to determine whether Subscriber limit orders are marketable and eligible for a potential match in the System.
