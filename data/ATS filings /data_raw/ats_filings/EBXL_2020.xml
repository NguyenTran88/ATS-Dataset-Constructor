Access to individual parts of the LeveL ATS trading systems (e.g., to subscriber confidential trading information) is permissioned at the user level.  The only employees of eBX with the ability to view open order interest in the LeveL ATS are certain members of eBX's Technology and Operations Personnel.  eBX's Technology and Operations Personnel are located in eBX's Charleston, SC office.

These reports are provided on a two-week delayed basis (i.e., no execution noted in any such report will have occurred within the two weeks prior to the report date).  Subscribers may also request that the FIX messages disseminated to the subscriber in connection with each execution in the ATS identify, as applicable, (i) whether the subscriber's order was deemed to provide or remove liquidity, (ii) whether the subscriber executed against itself, (iii) whether the subscriber executed against a third-party (rather than against itself)  and (iv) whether the subscriber's Firm Order  executed against a Firm-Up Order.

	             </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">Order Types (Generally):  The ATS accepts firm orders ("Firm Orders") and conditional (non-firm) "orders" ("Conditional Orders").  Except where otherwise noted, references to Firm Orders include Firm-Up Orders (as that term is defined herein).  All orders may be cancelled by timely submission to the ATS of cancellation instructions.<br><br>Firm Orders (Excluding Firm-Up Orders):  Firm Orders may include market, limit or pegged price instructions.  Subscribers may designate Firm Orders as immediate-or-cancel ("IOC"), "Day," good-till-time ("GTT," expressed either in seconds or by specifying an expiration time) or "enhanced" IOC (such orders "Enhanced IOC" orders, further discussed below).  Subscribers may designate Firm Orders as ineligible to interact with other orders if the NBBO spread, as calculated by the ATS, is greater than $0.01 (or greater than $0.0001 where an execution would occur at a price that is less than $1.00).  Subscribers may designate Firm Orders as add-liquidity-only ("ALO").  ALO orders will only interact with other orders if the ALO order would be deemed to be adding liquidity.  See Part III Item 11 for further discussion of when an order is deemed to "add" or "remove" liquidity.  Where, upon receipt, an ALO order is marketable against trading interest on the ATS, the ATS will accept the ALO order for further processing (e.g., potential matching where the ALO would be deemed to be adding liquidity).<br><br>Pegged orders are limit orders with a limit price that constantly changes based on movements in the designated reference price.  Pegged orders may, but are not required to, include an ultimate limit price (e.g., buy 100 shares of ABC pegged to the offer but limited to $20.05) and, for orders other than IOC and Enhanced IOC orders, may also include an offset price (e.g., buy 100 shares of ABC pegged to the national best offer ("NBO") minus $.02).  Firm Orders may be pegged to the NBO, the national best bid ("NBB") or midpoint of the national best bid or offer ("NBBO").<br><br>Offset prices must be expressed in penny increments per share for securities priced equal to or greater than $1.00 per share and hundredths of a cent for securities priced less than $1.00 per share or the ATS will reject the order.  Resting orders with offsets expressed in hundredths of a cent will be cancelled if the bid or offer becomes equal to or greater than $1.00 per share.  Orders pegged to the midpoint of the NBBO may not include a peg-offset.<br><br>As noted above, subscribers may designate orders as "Enhanced IOC" orders.  Generally, an Enhanced IOC order operates like a "standard" IOC order and either immediately executes (in whole or in part) against resting contraside interest or is cancelled by the ATS.  However, where there is a resting eligible contraside Conditional Order(s) in the ATS at the time the ATS receives the Enhanced IOC order, the Enhanced IOC order will remain in the ATS for a subscriber-configured period of time of at least 100 milliseconds (such period, which is configurable in millisecond increments, the "Hold Period").  For clarity, where there is both resting firm and conditional trading interest in the ATS at the time the ATS receives the Enhanced IOC order, the Enhanced IOC will execute, in whole or in part, against the firm order (which may be a Firm or Firm-Up Order) and the leaves quantity will be immediately cancelled.  During the Hold Period the Enhanced IOC order is eligible to interact with any eligible contraside trading interest in the ATS and may "invite" other Conditional Orders to "firm-up."  In the event the Enhanced IOC order receives a partial fill during the Hold Period the ATS will immediately cancel the order's leaves quantity (even where the Hold Period has not expired).  Subscribers may not cancel an Enhanced IOC order during the Hold Period.  For clarity, the Hold Period on a given order is not "extended" or "reset" for any reason.<br><br>Only Firm Orders may be designated as Enhanced IOC orders.  Enhanced IOC orders may only be used in connection with Session Permissioning instructions (as defined at Part III Item 14).  Orders designated as "Enhanced IOC" that do not utilize Session Permissioning instructions will be rejected.<br><br>By default, the ATS designates Firm Orders (including Enhanced IOC orders) as ineligible to interact with Conditional Orders.  However, eBX will remove the default designation upon subscriber request and permit the subscriber to designate Firm Orders as either eligible or ineligible to interact with Conditional Orders on an order-by-order basis.  Firm Orders designated as ineligible to interact with Conditional Orders will not invite a Conditional Order to firm-up, but are nevertheless eligible to interact with Firm-Up Orders (other than Firm-Up Orders that include a "conditional only" order instruction).<br><br>Firm Orders may be modified, but their firm status cannot be modified (i.e., a Firm Order cannot be modified to be a Conditional Order).  A modified Firm Order will receive a new time of receipt for priority purposes, except where the only modification is a reduction in order quantity.<br><br>CONDITIONAL ORDERS:  A Conditional Order is an instruction to the ATS that the subscriber wants to interact with the order book on a conditional basis.  A Conditional Order never executes; instead, when a Conditional Order would have otherwise matched with another order, the Conditional Order is canceled by the ATS and an invitation (i.e., an "Invite" as defined at Part III Item 9) is sent to the originating subscriber, inviting the subscriber to send a Firm-Up Order in response.  As further discussed below, Conditional Orders, by default, may only interact at the midpoint of the prevailing NBBO.  However, upon subscriber request to eBX, however made, eBX will remove the default logic and allow Conditional Orders that utilize Session Permissioning instructions to interact at any price at or inside the prevailing NBBO (such Conditional Orders designated as eligible  to interact at any price at or inside the prevailing NBBO, "Session Conditional Orders," all other Conditional Orders, "Non-Session Conditional Orders").  For clarity, as used herein the term "Conditional Order" includes both Session and Non-Session Conditional Orders unless otherwise specified.<br><br>Conditional Orders may include market, limit or pegged pricing instructions.  Subject to the restrictions discussed in this paragraph, Conditional Orders may be pegged to the NBB, NBO or midpoint of the NBBO.  Conditional Orders pegged to the market (i.e., sell order pegged to the NBB or buy order pegged to the NBO) may include an offset price (e.g., buy 100 shares of ABC pegged to the NBO minus $.02).  Conditional Orders pegged to the midpoint of the NBBO may not include an offset price.  Session Conditional Orders may be pegged to the primary (i.e., sell order pegged to the NBO or buy order pegged to the NBB) and may include an offset price.  Non-Session Conditional Orders may not be pegged to the primary; the ATS will reject any Non-Session Conditional Orders pegged to the primary.  As further discussed below, Conditional Orders must include a Minimum Block Size quantity.  Subscribers may designate Conditional Orders as "Day" or GTT.  Conditional Orders may not be designated as IOC or Enhanced IOC.  Conditional Orders may be modified, but their conditional status cannot be modified (i.e., a Conditional Order cannot be modified to be a Firm Order).  Conditional Orders may include instructions to not interact with Firm Orders other than Firm-Up Orders.  Any Firm-Up Order "resulting from" such a "conditional-only" Conditional Order must also include conditional-only instructions.  Firm Orders, other than Firm-Up Orders resulting from a "conditional-only" Conditional Order, may not include a conditional-only order attribute.  Non-Session Conditional Orders will only interact with contraside interest (i.e., "generate" an Invite) where the midpoint of the NBBO is an eligible execution price at the time of the match (that is, assuming both the Non-Session Conditional Order and contraside interest were firm orders).  Session Conditional Orders are eligible to interact at any price at or inside the NBBO.  Where "eligible" contraside interest exists, all eligible Conditional Orders will receive Invites, regardless of time of receipt.  Conditional Orders may include ALO instructions, in which case the party submitting the Conditional Order will only receive an Invite where the Conditional Order would have been deemed to add liquidity at the time of the match (that is, assuming both the Conditional Order and contraside interest were firm orders).  Subscribers may designate their Conditional Orders as ineligible to interact with other orders if the NBBO spread, as calculated by the ATS, is greater than $0.01 (or greater than $0.0001 where an execution would occur at a price that is less than $1.00).<br><br>FIRM-UP ORDERS:  Firm-Up Orders are firm orders submitted in response to an Invite (as defined at Item III, Part 9).  A Firm-Up Order must contain the same symbol, side, MPID and minimum block size quantity as the Conditional Order related to the Invite or it will be rejected by the ATS.  As further discussed herein, Firm-Up Orders resulting from Session Conditional Orders (such Firm-Up Orders, "Session Firm-Up Orders") and Firm-Up Orders resulting from Non-Session Conditional Orders (such Firm-Up Orders, "Non-Session Firm-Up Orders") differ in manner of operation.  A Firm-Up Order's status as a Session Firm-Up Order or Non-Session Firm-Up Order is determined exclusively on the Session or Non-Session status of the underlying Conditional Order, and, accordingly, the election of whether a Firm-Up Order operates as a Session or Non-Session Firm-Up Order is effectively made at the Conditional Order stage.  For clarity, the term "Firm-Up Order," as used herein, includes both Session and Non-Session Firm-Up Orders unless otherwise specified.<br><br>Subscribers may designate Firm-Up Orders as Day or GTT and must include a time-in-force of at least one (1) second if designated as GTT.  Firm-Up Orders may not be designated as IOC or Enhanced IOC.  As further discussed below, Non-Session Firm-Up Orders are only eligible to execute at the midpoint of the NBBO, while Session Firm-Up Orders are eligible to execute at any price at or inside the NBBO.  Firm-Up Orders may include market, limit or pegged pricing instructions.  Subject to the restrictions discussed in this paragraph, Firm-Up Orders may be pegged to the NBB, NBO or midpoint of the NBBO.  Firm-Up Orders pegged to the market (i.e., sell order pegged to the NBB or buy order pegged to the NBO) may include an offset price (e.g., buy 100 shares of ABC pegged to the NBO minus $.02).  Firm-Up Orders pegged to the midpoint of the NBBO may not include an offset price.  Session Firm-Up Orders may be pegged to the primary and may include an offset price.  Non-Session Firm-Up Orders may only be pegged to the primary where the NBBO is locked and the order's instructions permit it to cross in a locked-market; the ATS will otherwise reject any Non-Session Firm-Up Order pegged to the primary.  Where accepted, Non-Session Firm-Up Orders pegged to the primary may not include an offset price.<br><br>Non-Session Firm-Up Orders must either (a) have a pricing instruction that is at or better than the pricing instruction of the originating Conditional Order (e.g., a subscriber that submitted a market Conditional Order may submit a marketable limit Firm-Up Order) or (b) be priced at-or-better than the midpoint of the NBBO at the time of submission (e.g., a subscriber that submitted a market Conditional Order may submit a Firm-Up Order pegged to the midpoint of the NBBO).  Session Firm-Up Orders must have effective limit prices that, at the time of submission, are at least equal to the NBB (for buy orders) or NBO (for sell orders).<br><br>Firm-Up Orders resulting from Conditional Orders with ALO instructions must themselves include ALO instructions; where such a Firm-Up order does not include ALO instructions the ATS will reject the order (as noted above, Firm-Up Orders must include a time-in-force of at least one (1) second and may interact with orders other than the contraside order from the initial match).  The ATS will reject Firm-Up Orders with ALO instructions where the related Conditional Order did not include ALO instructions.<br><br>Subscribers may designate their Firm-Up Orders as ineligible to interact with other orders if the NBBO spread, as calculated by the ATS, is greater than $0.01 (or greater than $0.0001 where an execution would occur at a price that is less than $1.00).  Subscribers cannot designate their Firm-Up Orders as ineligible to interact with Conditional Orders, but may designate Firm-Up Orders as only eligible to interact with Conditional and Firm-Up Orders.<br><br>Firm-Up Orders are treated like "standard" Firm Orders for matching and priority purposes.  However, as noted above, Non-Session Firm-Up Orders are only eligible to execute at the midpoint of the NBBO.  Accordingly, Non-Session Firm-Up Orders with effective limit prices below the prevailing midpoint of the NBBO are ineligible for execution, although they will, in accordance with their terms, remain in the ATS and may subsequently become eligible for execution.  Where a Non-Session Firm-Up Order matches with a "standard" Firm Order, the execution will occur at the midpoint of the NBBO, without regard as to which order was deemed to add or remove liquidity.  Session Firm-Up Orders are treated like "standard" Firm Orders when determining both eligible execution prices and resulting execution price.<br><br>The ATS does not prevent subscribers from submitting Firm Orders that are not Firm-Up Orders following receipt of an Invite, although the ATS treats the subscriber as failing to have "firmed-up" in response to the Invite.  Firm-Up Orders may not be modified.<br><br>MINIMUM EXECUTION SIZE:  Subscribers may specify a "Minimum Quantity" or "Minimum Block Size" associated with a Firm Order.  Minimum quantities and minimum block sizes must be expressed in round (100-share) lots.  A "Minimum Quantity" instruction specifies the minimum execution size a subscriber will accept and allows for the aggregation of any number of contra-side orders.  A "Minimum Block Size" instruction specifies the minimum execution size a subscriber will accept and does not allow for the aggregation of contra-side interest.  A Minimum Quantity or Minimum Block Size instruction must be specified in multiples of 100 shares.  Conditional and Firm-Up Orders must include a Minimum Block Size instruction.  The ATS, however, will accept a Conditional or Firm-Up Order that includes a Minimum Quantity instruction, but it will treat the Minimum Quantity instruction as a Minimum Block Size instruction.<br><br>LEAVES QUANTITY; MINIMUM QUANTITY ORDERS:  Subscribers may instruct whether a Minimum Quantity order, following its initial execution, be cancelled back to the subscriber or remain eligible for additional executions.  Additionally, subscribers may include an instruction such that, where the leaves quantity of a Minimum Quantity order falls below its Minimum Quantity instruction, the ATS either (x) cancels back the order or (y) removes the Minimum Quantity instruction from the order (that is, disregard the Minimum Quantity instruction and allow the order to execute in any permitted lot size (e.g. 100 share lots)).<br><br>LEAVES QUANTITY; MINIMUM BLOCK SIZE ORDERS:  Subscribers may instruct whether a Minimum Block Size order, following its initial execution, be cancelled back to the subscriber or remain eligible for additional executions.  Additionally, subscribers may include an instruction such that, where the leaves quantity of a Minimum Block Size order falls below its Minimum Block Size, the ATS either (x) cancels back the order or (y) reduces the Minimum Block Size instruction to the size of the leaves quantity (for instance, if a 20,000 share order with a Minimum Block Size of 10,000 shares is party to an execution for 15,000 shares, the 5,000 share leaves quantity would remain eligible for execution and, effectively, be treated as having a 5,000 share Minimum Block Size instruction).<br><br>ORDER ROUTING:  The ATS does not route any order flow.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

For clarity, as used herein the term "Conditional Order" includes both Session and Non-Session Conditional Orders unless otherwise specified.<br><br>Conditional Orders may include market, limit or pegged pricing instructions.  Subject to the restrictions discussed in this paragraph, Conditional Orders may be pegged to the NBB, NBO or midpoint of the NBBO.

As further discussed below, Conditional Orders must include a Minimum Block Size quantity.  Subscribers may designate Conditional Orders as "Day" or GTT.  Conditional Orders may not be designated as IOC or Enhanced IOC.  Conditional Orders may be modified, but their conditional status cannot be modified (i.e., a Conditional Order cannot be modified to be a Firm Order).  Conditional Orders may include instructions to not interact with Firm Orders other than Firm-Up Orders.

	              </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The ATS receives subscribers' orders centrally for future processing and execution by operating a limit order matching book that allows subscribers to submit buy and sell orders and to obtain execution against matching orders submitted in the system.  Generally, the ATS accepts orders for all NMS stocks, although the ATS may reject orders in individual symbols to prevent exceeding certain regulatory thresholds (e.g., the fair access and Regulation SCI thresholds).<br><br>The ATS accepts both firm and conditional order interest.  Conditional orders receive invitations to "firm up" where eligible contraside interest exists.  While a subscriber's order interest is generally not displayed to other subscribers, firm-up invitations identify certain terms of the contraside order interest (e.g., the symbol and side of a contraside order, amongst other information).  Firm orders, other than firm orders sent in response to a firm-up invitation, may be designated as ineligible to interact with conditional orders and where so designated will not invite a conditional order to "firm up."<br><br>The ATS allows subscribers to designate orders as only eligible to interact with, or as ineligible to interact with, orders of designated subscribers.  Additionally, subscribers may elect to only interact with, or not interact with, certain groups of subscribers, including groups whose constituents are identified by eBX in its reasonable discretion (see Part III Items 13 and 14 for additional information).<br><br>Subscribers may utilize the ATS' counterparty permissioning functionality such that the subscriber's orders are solely eligible to interact with other orders submitted by the subscriber.  eBX anticipates that subscribers that are unable to trade report transactions will, or do, utilize this functionality as a means of crossing orders (either as principal or dual agent) and trade reporting or "printing" the resulting transactions.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

	                   c. Explain the established, non-discretionary rules and procedures of the NMS Stock ATS, including order interaction rules for the priority, pricing methodologies, allocation, matching, and execution of orders and trading interest, and other procedures governing trading, such as price improvement functionality, price protection mechanisms, short sales, locked-crossed markets, the handling of execution errors, and the time-stamping of orders and executions.
	              </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The ATS, outside of the Opening Cross and barring additional execution instructions, matches Firm Orders based on the following factors in the following order: (i) price and (ii) time.  All orders that are marketable against the NBBO (i.e., buy orders priced at or above the NBO and sell orders priced at or below the NBB) are treated as being on price parity, regardless of the order's actual limit price (e.g., all buy orders with limit prices at or above the NBO are treated as being on price parity).  For orders pegged to the midpoint of the NBBO, where (x) the prevailing midpoint is above $1.00, the ATS will round any implicit subpenny limit price down (for buy orders) or up (for sell orders) to the nearest multiple of $0.01 and (y) the prevailing midpoint is less than $1.00, the ATS, where applicable, will round any implicit limit price down (for buy orders) or up (for sell orders) to the nearest multiple of $0.0001.  Pegged orders are ranked based on their pegged price and not on any ultimate limit price associated with the order.  For purposes of establishing time priority the ATS treats pegged orders as received at the time of original order receipt, rather than as received at each subsequent price change.  Where a subscriber modifies a Firm Order, other than to reduce the order's size, the ATS treats the order as received at the time of modification.<br><br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Firm-Up Orders may not be modified.  The ATS, for the avoidance of doubt, treats a Firm-Up Order's time of receipt as the time the ATS receives the Firm-Up Order (and not the time the ATS received the related Conditional Order).  As between two orders to a match, the order treated by the ATS as having been received first is deemed to "add" liquidity, while the other order is deemed to "remove" liquidity.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Conditional Orders are not subject to the ATS' standard priority logic.  Rather, where contra-side trading interest exists, all eligible Conditional Orders will receive Invites (i.e., the Conditional Order received first will not have priority in receiving an Invite).<br><br>Where two Firm Orders are eligible to be matched at multiple price levels, they will execute at the midpoint of the eligible execution prices.  For example, where the NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05, and the ATS receives a limit order to buy at $20.10 and a limit order to sell at $20.02, the limit buy order will be repriced to the NBO (here $20.05) in calculating the midpoint of the orders' eligible execution prices, and the orders will be executed at $20.035 (i.e., the midpoint of eligible execution prices, and not the midpoint of the NBBO).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Firm-Up Order is only eligible to execute at the midpoint of the NBBO and, for the avoidance of doubt, executions between Firm Orders and Firm-Up Orders will only occur at the midpoint of the NBBO.  The ATS will not execute any order outside the NBBO, including in the Opening Crosses.<br><br>The ATS disregards any "intermarket-sweep order" designation included with an order.  The ATS does not execute orders when the NBBO is crossed.  By default, all orders submitted by a subscriber are eligible to execute when the NBBO is locked.  However, subscribers may (i) designate, on an order-by-order basis, whether an order is eligible to execute when the NBBO is locked or (ii) designate all orders submitted via a FIX session as ineligible to execute when the NBBO is locked.<br><br>The ATS will apply the priorities detailed above with respect to eligible orders and prices only.  To the extent an order entered into the ATS may not, by law, rule, regulation or the terms of the order, (i) be crossed with another order, (ii) be crossed at a particular price or (iii) be crossed with a particular subscriber or desk, then such orders will be ineligible for matching or, where applicable, the price adjusted to a permissible price.  The ATS will not execute short sale orders at the NBB when a circuit breaker is in effect, although short sales may otherwise be executed at permitted prices.  Orders submitted at prices that are impermissible by law or rule (e.g., Rule 612 of Regulation NMS) will be rejected.<br><br>Where a subscriber utilizes Internalization-Only functionality (further described in Part III Item 14 below), that subscriber's order will only be eligible to interact with other orders submitted by that subscriber.  As a general matter, eBX understands subscribers utilize this functionality to cross orders of the subscriber's underlying customers (or fill the underlying customer's order as principal) and leverage eBX's trade reporting capabilities.<br>Trading errors resulting in the ATS are recorded in eBX's error accounts.  eBX views trading errors as transactions in the wrong security or side of the market, executions outside an order's limit price, executions based on latent market data and executions at clearly erroneous prices.  eBX handles executions at clearly erroneous prices consistent with the applicable rules of the self-regulatory organizations.  Potential trading errors can be raised by subscribers or identified by eBX personnel. eBX compliance, after confirming activity represents a trading error, will attempt to place the subscriber in the position it would have been in had the error not occurred.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

				  </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">eBX groups all subscribers into one or more of the following groups (the "Predetermined Counterparty Groups").  Subscribers are grouped at the MPID level.  As such, a subscriber with multiple MPIDs may be included in multiple Predetermined Counterparty Groups, but each individual MPID will only be included in a single Predetermined Counterparty Group.  Predetermined Counterparty Groups include subscribers whose order characteristics or general business model eBX has determined are reasonably characterized as representing (i) agency algorithms or smart-order-routers, (ii) broker-dealers, (iii) exchanges or other ATSs, (iv) electronic market-makers, (v) high-touch agency broker-dealers, (vi) high-touch proprietary broker-dealers, (vii) low-touch prop and (viii) sponsored access arrangements.<br><br>Predetermined Counterparty Group classifications are determined by eBX.  While certain objective criteria is employed (such as whether a subscriber is primarily submitting agency or principal order interest, whether a subscriber's order flow represents ATS or exchange exhaust, and the percentage of orders that are deemed to add or remove liquidity (used in determining whether a subscriber is a member of the electronic market-makers or low-touch prop Predetermined Counterparty Group)), determinations are largely based on subjective criteria.  Additionally, while certain Predetermined Counterparty Groups represent primarily agency or principal trading interest, eBX does not restrict any Predetermined Counterparty Group to trading interest that is exclusively agency or principal (e.g., MPIDs categorized as "agency algorithms or smart-order-routers" may include MPIDs that submit both agency and principal trading interest).<br><br>Predetermined Counterparty Group categorization occurs at subscriber onboarding and whenever a subscriber uses a "new" MPID to connect to the ATS.  eBX informs subscribers of their Predetermined Counterparty Group(s) at onboarding, following the addition a "new" MPID and, where applicable, following any change in categorization.  While subscribers may provide eBX with information regarding the order flow associated with an MPID and the subscriber's view on the appropriate Predetermined Counterparty Group, categorization is ultimately in eBX's sole discretion.  eBX personnel may elect to revise an MPID's Predetermined Counterparty Group categorization in the event eBX learns of changes in the associated order flow.  eBX does not disclose a subscriber's Predetermined Counterparty Group categorization(s) to other subscribers.<br><br>Subscribers may request that eBX "create" a Custom Counterparty Group (as further described in Part III Item 14).  Custom Counterparty Groups (together with Predetermined Counterparty Groups, the "Counterparty Groups") represent groups of subscribers that exhibit certain objective characteristics that a subscriber wishes to either solely interact with or not interact with.  For example, a Custom Counterparty Group may include subscribers that, on average, submit a Firm-Up Order in response to an Invite at least 50% of the time.  A subscriber's ability to utilize a proposed Custom Counterparty Group is dependent on eBX's willingness and ability to support such a proposed Custom Counterparty Group.  eBX will not create Custom Counterparty Groups that utilize subjective criteria as a factor (for instance, eBX will reject a request to create a Custom Counterparty Group that represents "toxic" order flow).  Inclusion in a Custom Counterparty Group is assessed at the MPID level.<br><br>eBX does not inform subscribers of Custom Counterparty Groups being utilized by other subscribers.  Further, eBX does not identify the constituent members of a Custom Counterparty Group to the subscriber "utilizing" the Custom Counterparty Group.  eBX periodically updates the constituent members of each Custom Counterparty Group.  The time period between updates varies based on the criteria employed in the specific Custom Counterparty Group.  However, where the criteria for a Custom Counterparty Group is the percentage of time a subscriber submits a Firm-Up Order in response to an Invite, eBX will update the group's members following the end of each calendar quarter.<br><br>Subscribers may elect to only interact with, or not interact with, one or more Counterparty Groups.
