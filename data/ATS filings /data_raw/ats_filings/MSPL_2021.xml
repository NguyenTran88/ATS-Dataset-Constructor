        <taPart2Item2aAfflThatEnterInterest>MS&amp;Co has affiliates, including investment advisers, investment companies, U.S. broker-dealers, foreign broker dealers or equivalent entities, non broker-dealers, and bank regulated entities. Any such affiliate can enter an order in ATS-4, either for that affiliate's own account or as agent or riskless principal on behalf of the affiliate's client(s). Such orders are classified either as agency or principal on the books and records of the Broker-Dealer Operator, as described in the response to Part III, Item 7(a) and subject to the priority rules described in response to Part III, Items 7(a) and 11(a) and the counter-party selection/opt-out processes described in response to Part II, Item 3.

Since the effective date of the initial Form ATS-N for ATS-4, the following affiliates have executed orders in ATS-4:

As indicated, the above is a list of affiliates that have historically executed orders in ATS-4. The Broker-Dealer Operator will update this list to add any affiliate that subsequently executes orders in ATS-4 and to remove any entity that ceases to be an affiliate of the Broker-Dealer Operator.</taPart2Item2aAfflThatEnterInterest>

        <taPart2Item6aUnitAfflEmployeeServices>The Broker-Dealer Operator does not run ATS-4 as a separate business, but rather operates it as one trading product or venue within the full service broker-dealer. There are no employees exclusively dedicated to ATS-4. MS&amp;Co considers confidential trading information of ATS-4 to be (1) order-related information received by ATS-4; (2) execution-related information in ATS-4 (including identities of contra-parties to an execution); and (3) data and analytics related solely to the activity of ATS-4 (with the exception of information made publicly available pursuant to reporting rules and regulations). Listed below are the shared employees (which include employees and personnel such as consultants, temporary workers, and contingent workers of Morgan Stanley Services Group, Inc. (MSSG), an affiliated service entity that provides MS&amp;Co and affiliates with certain inter-company services including, infrastructure group support, information processing, communications and occupancy, and equipment) that service both ATS-4 and MS&amp;Co or an MS&amp;Co affiliate and have access to confidential trading information of ATS-4, along with the basis for such access. - Information Technology and Operations employees: Various technology groups of MSSG and MS&amp;Co are responsible for developing, monitoring, and testing and otherwise supporting various systems within MS&amp;Co's trading infrastructure. Employees within these groups include developers, systems engineers, or network engineers for MS&amp;Co systems, including ATS-4. They are responsible for reviewing and testing the coding, systems infrastructure, and network infrastructure that supports the MS&amp;Co trading infrastructure including ATS-4 to ensure stability and continued functionality and are also responsible for developing, testing, and implementing additional functionalities for ATS-4 as needed. Certain of these technology-related employees have access to the real-time production environment for ATS-4. As a result and in order to support the operation and infrastructure of ATS-4, these technology-related employees are able to access databases containing order-related and execution-related information and other confidential trading information of ATS-4. Similarly, certain Operations employees support the clearance and settlement of transactions effected through MS&amp;Co including transactions effected on ATS-4. Those employees require access to confidential information of the Broker-Dealer Operator including confidential trading information of ATS-4, such as execution-related information and allocation information on order records, to assist in issues relating to clearance and settlement of such transactions. - Sales and Trading employees: Sales and trading employees, including account coverage, handle orders on behalf of clients. This could involve providing trading discretion to determine when and how to handle an order, including routing an order directly or indirectly to ATS-4 among other market centers. Account representatives assigned to clients whose orders may be entered in ATS-4 (among other market centers) have access, with respect to each applicable client, to the order information prior to such information being entered into ATS-4 and, as a result of servicing such client, have access to execution-related information, including the fact that such client's order was matched in ATS-4 with an order from another Participant in ATS-4. Such sales and trading employees have access to their client information prior to entry and after execution in ATS-4. Account representatives have system entitlements only for the clients they cover and only have visibility into where an order was ultimately routed and/or executed, whether to/in ATS-4 or any other market center. - Risk Management personnel: MS&amp;Co has employees that perform business unit risk management functions including market risk, non-market risk, credit risk, and technology risk with respect to the businesses of the Broker-Dealer Operator including ATS-4. In performing these functions, these employees have access to order and execution information and other confidential information relating to Morgan Stanley business activities, including confidential trading information of ATS-4, such as order-related information, execution-related information, and client or desk trading activity. - Supervisory and Oversight employees: Employees acting in a supervisory or oversight capacity (including employees performing reviews at the direction of such employees) have access to confidential information relating to Morgan Stanley business activities, including confidential trading information of ATS-4. Certain of these employees, among other responsibilities, have supervisory responsibilities reasonably designed to ensure that ATS-4 operates as intended. They are also responsible for evaluating and reviewing Participant performance, assessing Participant trading activity in connection with classification as a Professional Trader or not as a Professional Trader (See Part III, Item 13), reviewing market developments to adhere to regulatory obligations, and conducting analyses in connection with the foregoing. In furtherance of these responsibilities, these employees have access to confidential trading information of ATS-4. - Legal, Compliance and other Guardianship functions: Employees in the Legal and Compliance Departments and others involved in complying with regulatory requirements support, with respect to such requirements, the businesses of MS&amp;Co, including the business of ATS-4. These employees provide such support by, among other functions, responding to regulatory inquiries, conducting compliance and other reviews, performing internal audits of the trading infrastructure of the Broker-Dealer Operator (including the trading infrastructure supporting ATS-4), all with respect to activity within ATS-4. In the course of performing such functions and generally providing support to ATS-4, those employees have access, on an as-needed basis, to confidential trading information of ATS-4, such as order-related and execution-related information in ATS-4. Certain personnel from the groups listed above participate in the meetings described in Part III, Item 13(a) to classify a Participant as a professional trader or not a professional trader. As such, those personnel have access to confidential trading information of ATS-4 but may only use the information obtained in or through such meetings for the purpose of such meetings and may not use such information for any unauthorized purpose.</taPart2Item6aUnitAfflEmployeeServices>

      <taPart2Item7aDescrOfSafeGaurdsAndProcedures>MS&amp;Co maintains restrictions (including permissioned access) and policies and procedures designed to safeguard the confidential trading information of ATS-4. Access to confidential trading information of ATS-4 is limited to the shared employees described in Part II, Item 6(a) (that is, information technology and operations employees; sales and trading employees; risk management employees; supervisory and oversight employees; and legal, compliance, and other with guardianship functions), to the systems that support ATS-4, and smart order routing technology of MS&amp;Co. A description of applicable safeguards and oversight procedures is provided below. - Systems with Access to Order and Execution-Related Information: The order and execution management systems used by the sales and trading employees (including account representatives) described in response to Part II, Item 6(a), can route orders to ATS-4, among other destinations. Similarly, smart order routing technology and algorithmic trading products of MS&amp;Co can route orders to ATS-4 among other destinations. These systems receive information regarding where such orders were routed and/or executed, which could be ATS-4 or could be any other market center. In addition, the smart order routing technology of the Broker-Dealer Operator has access to the full order book of ATS-4 on a continuous basis. MS&amp;Co maintains a database containing trading information of its NMS Stock ATSs. Authorized employees (generally, authorized information technology and operations employees and certain authorized sales and trading employees, as needed, all as described in Part II, Item 6(a)) have access to the database in order to run queries and generate reports of trading activity within ATS-4. Examples of such reports are volume reports, order-to-fill ratio reports, message count reports, and monthly statistics of ATS-4 activity which are made publicly available. (See Part III, Item 26.) - Use of System Entitlements: MS&amp;Co assigns permissioned logins to access ATS-4 and other aspects of MS&amp;Co's trading infrastructure. These permissioned logins serve as controls to protect confidential trading information, including confidential trading information of ATS-4. Relevant supervisors must approve all employee access to ATS-4 as well as other MS&amp;Co systems with access to order and execution information. Access privileges are aligned to business function and designated reviewers evaluate access based upon the employee's current role. Access is revoked when no longer required or upon an employee's termination. An employee that previously had access to confidential trading information of ATS-4 will no longer have access to such information upon revocation. Additionally, pursuant to written supervisory procedures governing access to MS&amp;Co NMS Stock ATSs, a supervisor conducts a quarterly review of access and entitlements relating to ATS-4. This review is designed to confirm that those with access should continue to have access and also addresses whether any individual has transferred roles such that he or she should no longer require access. - Application of Global Cyber Security Program: Morgan Stanley's global cyber security program, including measures designed to detect and prevent unauthorized intrusions to Morgan Stanley systems, apply to MS&amp;Co's trading infrastructure, including ATS-4. - Use of Information Barriers: MS&amp;Co maintains information barriers to separate employees and systems with access to confidential trading information of its NMS Stock ATSs from those not permitted to access such information. These information barriers serve as controls to protect confidential trading information, including confidential trading information of ATS-4. Morgan Stanley maintains a network firewall and customer gateways that surround its trading infrastructure, including ATS-4, for security purposes. Subscribers (excluding Subscribers affiliated with the Broker-Dealer Operator) connect from outside that firewall and those customer gateways. The firewall and customer gateways seek to protect access to confidential information of Morgan Stanley, including confidential trading information of ATS-4. - Personal Trading Policy and Restrictions: MS&amp;Co prohibits all employees, including those with access to confidential trading information of ATS-4, from trading based on non-public or other confidential information, which would include confidential information of clients and, more specifically, confidential trading information in ATS-4. Pursuant to the Morgan Stanley Global Employee Trading, Investing, and Outside Business Activities Policy and a supplement to that policy governing the Global Sales and Trading Divisions including the Institutional Equity Division of MS&amp;Co, employees (unless an exception is granted) must effect personal transactions in Employee Securities Account maintained at Morgan Stanley. Further, the Morgan Stanley Global Employee Trading Policy requires employees to seek pre-approval for purchases and sales of securities (unless the Global Employee Trading Policy or applicable supplement provides an exemption for a specific type of security, such as an ETF). In addition, employees generally must hold securities purchased in their Employee Securities Accounts for a minimum of 30 calendar days (or obtain pre-approval for such sale prior to 30 calendar days under exceptional circumstances.) Employees are prohibited from effecting transactions that raise an actual or apparent conflict of interest with MS&amp;Co or its clients or in securities on Morgan Stanley's Restricted List. Pursuant to applicable written policies and procedures, compliance and supervisory personnel, as applicable, review employee personal trading activity. Such reviews are designed to confirm compliance with MS&amp;Co's policies regarding pre-approval, holding period, conflicts of interest (including trading based upon confidential trading information), and Restricted List compliance. - Morgan Stanley Code of Conduct: Morgan Stanley requires all employees to be bound by and observe its Code of Conduct, including provisions that address the handling of client information and impose a duty of confidentiality.</taPart2Item7aDescrOfSafeGaurdsAndProcedures>

      <taPart3Item7AOrdrTypExplain>The response to Part III, Item 11(a) provides additional information regarding the manner in which orders interact in ATS-4 and it may be helpful to review that Item first for applicable background. ATS-4 accepts market and limit orders (including buy, sell, sell short, and sell short exempt orders), which, in each case, may also be designated with a peg instruction. ATS-4 accepts Day orders and IOC orders (as Time in Force attributes), although only smart order routing technology of the Broker-Dealer Operator is permitted to send IOC orders to ATS-4 to seek an immediate match. If liquidity is available in ATS-4 at a price that is at or within the best bid and best offer from markets that display protected quotations as defined in Regulation NMS (the best bid and offer), the Broker-Dealer Operator's smart order routing technology, based on its view of liquidity in ATS-4 (i.e., the full order book), may access such liquidity by sending an IOC order to ATS-4. Subscribers and the Broker-Dealer Operator accessing ATS-4 directly are permitted to enter day orders, but not IOC orders. Participants and the Broker-Dealer Operator's smart order routing technology and algorithmic trading products can designate an order sent to ATS-4 with a minimum fill quantity instruction. ATS-4 does not aggregate multiple contra-side orders to satisfy a minimum fill quantity on a single order. The minimum fill quantity constraint applies to every execution in ATS-4, except where the unexecuted portion of an order is less than the minimum fill quantity, in which case ATS-4 will not cancel the unexecuted quantity and such quantity will remain in ATS-4 for execution. ATS-4 does not support post-only orders. ATS-4 does not route orders to other Trading Centers. ATS-4 employs price/capacity/size/time matching priority, which encourages size and deemphasizes speed (rather than prioritizing time over size). Orders from Participants not classified as professional traders are given priority over both principal orders (as defined below in this section) and orders from Participants classified as professional traders. The price used for determining order priority is the price at or closest to the midpoint at which the order can be executed. An order may be designated with an instruction to be pegged to the near side of the best bid and offer or the midpoint of the best bid and offer. Because orders in ATS-4 cannot be executed at a price higher than the best offer or lower than the best bid, all orders in ATS-4 without a peg instruction are treated as if they were pegged to the far side of the best bid or offer, subject to any applicable limit price. An order pegged to the near side of the best bid and offer that has ever been repriced to a peg price other than its limit price yields time priority to other orders with the same price, capacity, and size. An order that ATS-4 receives from an affiliate of the Broker-Dealer Operator on behalf of that affiliate's client(s) is classified as an agency order. An order that ATS-4 receives from an affiliate trading for the affiliate's own account for the affiliate's client facilitation/market making activity (which the Broker-Dealer Operator handles as agent for its affiliate) yields priority to other agency orders (and is classified as an agency order for counterparty selection/opt-out purposes as described in Part II, Item 3). An order that ATS-4 receives from an affiliate for the affiliate's own account other than for the affiliate's client facilitation/market making activity is deemed a principal order by Morgan Stanley for priority and for counterparty selection/opt-out purposes, notwithstanding that the Broker-Dealer Operator's capacity otherwise would be as agent for its affiliate. An order could lose execution priority to a later arriving order at the same price if the later arriving order ranks higher with respect to other priority factors such as size or capacity. This is because ATS-4 prioritizes size over time and capacity over both size and time. In addition, as described above, an order pegged to the near side of the best bid and offer that has ever been repriced to a peg price other than its limit price yields time priority to other orders with the same price, capacity, and size. An order receives a new time stamp when it enters ATS-4 and when any term of the order is subsequently amended by the party entering it, other than a decrease in quantity/size.</taPart3Item7AOrdrTypExplain>

The Broker-Dealer Operator's smart order routing technology does not send IOC orders until trading has opened (or re-opened) on ATS-4. For opening in a subject NMS stock, trading on ATS-4 begins once there is an execution in that NMS stock on its primary exchange. As an exception to this practice, the Broker-Dealer Operator may choose to operate ATS-4 during normal trading hours when the primary exchange is not operating if the Broker-Dealer Operator deems there to be sufficient liquidity in the marketplace in the applicable NMS stock. For re-opening, trading is triggered by the primary exchange providing notification of its trading status. For both opening and re-opening, the Broker-Dealer Operator may also (for example, in exceptional market conditions such as periods of volatility) issue an administrative command not to initiate trading on ATS-4.</taPart3Item10aOpenReOpenDtls>

      <taPart3Item11aStrucOfNmsStk>ATS-4 is a real-time continuous match dark pool. ATS-4 tracks on a real-time basis, for each NMS stock eligible to be matched through it, the best bid and offer. The Broker-Dealer Operator lists on the website provided in response to Part I, Item 6 and otherwise provides monthly notice of those NMS stocks not eligible to be matched in ATS-4.

Generally, the NMS stocks not eligible for matching in ATS-4 are securities with a regulatory or practical limitation on matching, such as securities on Morgan Stanley's restricted list, securities for which Morgan Stanley is the issuer, securities for which ATS-4 is approaching the 5% volume threshold under Regulation ATS, or the volume/notional thresholds under Regulation SCI, or securities with anomalous characteristics. This could result in the suspension of matching in individual securities, including those with high volumes, to stay under such thresholds.

Orders matched by ATS-4 are matched initially at the midpoint of the best bid and offer to the extent such a match is possible. To the extent that there are remaining unmatched orders after the midpoint match, such orders will be matched at a price that is at or within the best bid and offer (the matching range). In general, ATS-4 attempts to match buy and sell orders at the midpoint of the best bid and offer. If orders remain after midpoint matching (for example, a buy order and a sell order each with limit prices below the midpoint), ATS-4 will run the matching algorithm again, starting at a matching price closest to the midpoint. This process will repeat to seek to match orders at other prices within the appropriate matching range, incrementally moving away from the midpoint.

To illustrate, consider the following. The best bid and offer is $50.00 - $50.10. ATS-4 would match a limit order to buy at $50.08 with a market order to sell at the midpoint match price, $50.05. Assume that after the midpoint match, there remains a limit order to buy at $50.04 and a limit order to sell at $50.02. ATS-4 will match these orders (which could not have matched at the midpoint of $50.05) at $50.04, the next match price closest to the midpoint match price.

ATS-4 employs price/capacity/size/time matching priority, which encourages size and deemphasizes speed (rather than prioritizing time over size). As described in response to Part III, Item 13, a Participant can be classified as a professional trader or not classified as a professional trader. The term "capacity" refers to whether a Participant is classified as a professional trader, is not classified as a professional trader, is entering an order deemed principal by Morgan Stanley, or is entering an order deemed agent by Morgan Stanley, as described in Part III, Item 7(a). Orders from Participants not classified as professional traders are given priority with respect to capacity over both principal orders (as defined in response to Part III, Item 7(a)) and orders from Participants classified as professional traders. The price used for determining order priority is the price at or closest to the midpoint at which the order can be executed. An order deemed agent can be for a Participant classified as a professional trader or for a Participant not classified as a professional trader. Similarly, an order deemed principal can be for a Participant classified as a professional trader or for a Participant not classified as a professional trader.</taPart3Item11aStrucOfNmsStk>

As described in those sections, the Broker-Dealer Operator permits (i) Participants not classified as professional traders to opt out of interacting with Participants classified as professional traders in ATS-4 and (ii) Participants to opt out of interacting with orders deemed principal orders in ATS-4 by Morgan Stanley, as described in Part III, Item 7(a). For clarity, a Participant classified as a professional trader cannot opt out of interacting with other Participants classified as professional traders.

ATS-4 accepts short sale orders and short sale exempt orders and the Broker-Dealer Operator handles such orders pursuant to the policies and procedures adopted pursuant to Rule 201(b) of Regulation SHO.

ATS-4 does not execute transactions in NMS stocks that are the subject of a locked or crossed market.

An order that ATS-4 receives from an affiliate for the affiliate's own account other than for the affiliate's client facilitation/market making activity is deemed a principal order by Morgan Stanley for priority and for counterparty selection/opt-out purposes, notwithstanding that the Broker-Dealer Operator's capacity otherwise would be as agent for its affiliate.

In the event of an error of ATS-4 or of the Broker-Dealer Operator, the Broker-Dealer Operator will bust the trade or handle the liquidation or covering of the error position in a Morgan Stanley error account.

An order receives a new time stamp when it enters ATS-4 and when any term of the order is subsequently amended by the party entering it, other than a decrease in quantity/size. Orders and executions are timestamped with microsecond granularity.</taPart3Item11cRulsProcsOfNmsStk>

The Broker-Dealer Operator evaluates the nature and frequency of a Participant's activities based upon average daily message count and number of shares executed per order. Such classifications are made on a monthly basis, but can be made intra-month if there is an extraordinary change in a Participant's activities during that month. Principal orders for the Broker-Dealer Operator and principal orders for an affiliate of the Broker-Dealer Operator are deemed principal orders in ATS-4, as described in Part III, Item 7(a). It is possible for one or more trading desks or business units of the Broker-Dealer Operator or an affiliate of the Broker-Dealer Operator to be classified as a professional trader if it meets the criteria for such classification. Segmentation can affect order interaction in the following manner. An order from a Participant not classified as a professional trader is given priority over both orders deemed principal orders in ATS-4 and orders from Participants classified as professional traders. In addition, the Broker-Dealer Operator permits (i) Participants not classified as professional traders to opt out of interacting with Participants classified as professional traders in ATS-4 and (ii) Participants to opt out of interacting with orders deemed principal orders in ATS-4, as described in Part III, Item 7(a).

For clarity, a Participant classified as a professional trader cannot opt out of interacting with other Participants classified as professional traders. In addition, orders may be designated (a) not to interact with certain orders to comply with regulatory requirements (such as requirements under ERISA for applicable accounts relating to principal and agency crosses); (b) not to cross with orders from the same Participant (where crossing may otherwise be permitted); and (c) to execute in an amount not less than a minimum quantity indicated as described in Part III, Item 7(a). Such designations can be made on an order-by-order basis by the Participant or as a default setting for that Participant set by the Broker-Dealer Operator at the Participant's request.

      <taPart3Item22aMtrlArngmntDtls>MS&amp;Co is a member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation ("NSCC") and the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). MS&amp;Co clears and settles securities transactions through established clearance and settlement protocols. If the transaction is with a client that custodies its assets at MS&amp;Co, MS&amp;Co will clear and settle the transaction in that client's account. If the transaction is with a client that clears and settles on a delivery-versus-payment/receive-versus-payment (DVP/RVP) basis through a third-party custodian, MS&amp;Co will clear and settle the transaction with the third-party custodian on a DVP/RVP basis. If the transaction is with a broker-dealer, the transaction will clear through NSCC and settle through DTC on a broker-to-broker basis. If the match is between two internal business units or trading desks of MS&amp;Co or between two internal business units or trading desks of an affiliate, there is no change of beneficial ownership and therefore no transaction to clear or settle. As indicated in Part III, Item 22(b) and Part III, Item 21(a), such matches are treated as journal entries. There are no procedures or material arrangements specific to ATS-4 (as compared to the procedures or arrangements generally of the Broker-Dealer Operator described above) to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions. The Broker-Dealer Operator is the counterparty to all trades effected in ATS-4. The Broker-Dealer Operator is a self-clearing broker and has not entered into any arrangements for clearance and settlement other than those arrangements customary for self-clearing brokers (e.g., DTC membership) and broker-to-broker settlement.</taPart3Item22aMtrlArngmntDtls>

        <taPart3Item22bDiffDtls>As indicated in the response to Part III, Item 22(a), settlement practices vary based upon whether a client custodies its assets at the Broker-Dealer Operator; whether the client settles on a DVP/RVP basis through a third party custodian; and whether the client is a broker-dealer. In addition, as indicated in the response to Part III, Item 21(a), where appropriate, matches between two internal business units or trading desks of the Broker-Dealer Operator or of an affiliate are treated as journal entries (internal movements of positions and monies), do not result in a change in beneficial ownership, and therefore are not trade reported. As indicated in Part III, Item 22(a), such journal entries do not require clearance and settlement.</taPart3Item22bDiffDtls>

      <taPart3Item23aMrktDatSrc>ATS-4 uses direct exchange market data feeds (or the SIP feed for any exchange that does not make available a direct exchange market data feed) to determine the best bid and offer from all markets that display protected quotations as defined in Regulation NMS.  The best bid and offer is used, in turn, to determine the midpoint or other relevant price for execution in ATS-4.  ATS-4 also uses the SIP feed for regulatory purposes (e.g., to determine whether a market is open or closed; whether a security is subject to a trading halt; and whether short sale restrictions are in effect) and for backup purposes.  The Broker-Dealer Operator uses the SIP feed as a backup when there is an issue or the perception of an issue with a market's direct feed or with the Broker-Dealer Operator's ability to receive and process the data from such market's feed.  The Broker-Dealer Operator makes such determinations on a market-by-market basis.</taPart3Item23aMrktDatSrc>
