Access to subscriber confidential trading information is only granted to employees directly involved in ongoing ATS operations (product, technology, reporting, client coverage, etc.). For a complete list of employee groups that may have access to confidential trading information please see Part II Item 7d. Any access request to the ATS system or related system that would contain confidential trading information is reviewed by line supervisor and product or database owner to determine whether the employee requires access to the specified system. In addition, access to the relevant systems is reviewed twice a year by NFS management, as well as following certain employee role changes, and may be adjusted as needed. NFS has also implemented controls to ensure that certain actions, transactions and/or critical business functions that support NFS' proprietary information assets and resources are traceable to an individual user or account. The System. The ATS is operated independently from NFS's other electronic trading products (e.g. algorithms, smart order router). Firm policy prohibits unauthorized access or use of subscriber confidential trading information. Access to subscriber confidential trading information is only granted to employees directly involved in ongoing ATS operations (product, technology, reporting, etc.). Any subscriber confidential trading information accessed by employees is used only to support ATS operations. NFS maintains a system of procedures, including individual access control requests, periodic reviews of existing system access, employee trading surveillance to prevent the unauthorized access of subscriber confidential trading information and to surveil the use of such information by NFS personnel authorized to access such information. Participants access the ATS through point-to-point network cross connects, managed private networks, or over secure Internet connections. Data in transit over the Internet is encrypted. In addition, the ATS employs firewalls to isolate the ATS systems from the Internet. ATS systems are also kept current with the latest released patches to help keep the systems secure. The ATS identifies cybersecurity risk using a company-wide approach that starts with understanding the business risks and then clearly identifying the assets, systems, and capabilities we protect, and the parties dedicated to protecting them. We focus on the following areas: Asset Management (i.e. data, personnel, devices, systems and facilities), Business Environment, Governance, Risk Assessment, and Risk Management Strategy. The extensive controls and risk management programs we have in place are aligned to the cybersecurity framework established by the National Institute of Technology and Standards (NIST). The framework is Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. This framework is used to understand the current state of cybersecurity risks, identify opportunities to achieve a desired future state, and continuously keep up with the ever-changing threat landscape. The ATS system is hosted in Cyxtera and Equinix data centers and subject to high security standards, including video surveillance, 24x7 armed security, and multi-factor physical access. The physical and operational security controls at these data centers are assessed by independent third parties annually. The facilities maintain multiple backup power systems to help ensure continuous operation in the event of electrical power failure. FMR maintains a Rules for Employee Investing Policy (the "EIP") which covers employees of all U.S. subsidiaries, including NFS, regardless of their role or responsibilities. Employees must complete policy training at onboarding and on an annual basis are required to complete a compliance questionnaire that includes acknowledgement of their adherence to this policy. The EIP is designed to encourage long-term investments, generally prohibit employees from engaging in excessive trading, and prevent the misuse of confidential trading information. The EIP requires employees to maintain brokerage accounts only at firm that have agreed to provide NFS daily trading information for employee personal accounts. EIP covered securities, which includes a majority of symbols eligible for trading in the ATS, are subject to a 60-day holding period and NFS employees are required to preclear any trade prior to placing an order. Employees must receive confirmation approving a covered transaction before executing the transaction and employee transactions are periodically reviewed for, amongst other things, misuse of confidential information. Violation of any company policy, and any other form of misconduct, may lead to disciplinary or corrective action up to and including dismissal.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

	             </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">Standard Cross Order Types. The Standard Cross supports three basic firm order types: (i) limit orders, (ii) market orders, and (iii) pegged orders, which includes unpriced pegged orders, pegged limit orders and pegged discretionary orders. Orders may also be designated as add liquidity only orders ("ALO Orders"). Orders may have a time-in-force of "day" or immediate-or-cancel ("IOC"). Pegged orders are derived limit orders pegged to the national best bid ("NBB"), national best offer ("NBO") or midpoint of the NBBO. A subscriber may designate an ultimate limit price for each pegged order. Pegged discretionary orders are pegged orders with an additional higher (buy) or lower (sell) price at which the order may be executed if the order cannot be executed with a contra side order at the pegged order's derived limit price (e.g., peg order to buy at the midpoint of the NBBO with discretion to the NBO). Pegged discretionary orders may only permit discretion to the NBB, NBO or midpoint of the NBBO. At no time will a peg or discretion instruction violate a client's ultimate limit price. ALO Orders may only add liquidity to the ATS and will not be matched with a contra-side order if the effect would be to remove liquidity from the ATS. ALO Orders may not cross with other orders during a locked market, even if adding liquidity. Where, upon receipt, an ALO order is marketable against trading interest on the ATS the ATS will accept the ALO order for further processing (e.g., potential matching). ALO Orders will remain in the system until cancelled or matched with a counterparty. Generally, for two given orders, the order received first will be deemed to be adding liquidity. Where orders have a discretionary instruction, activation of the discretionary price will be deemed to be removing liquidity regardless whether the order was received first or second. However, if both orders in a cross have their discretionary prices activated, then order receipt time again determines which order adds or removes liquidity. Orders that are derivatively priced will be treated as if cancelled and replaced for each price change and, accordingly, will vary from adding to removing liquidity without regard to whether such order was originally received first or second. A cancel replace will reset the order's time stamp. Conditional Cross Order Types. The Conditional Cross supports conditional, or "non-firm," orders ("Conditional Orders") and "Firm-Up Orders" submitted in response to proposed matches (as further discussed herein). Neither Conditional Orders nor Firm-Up Orders may be designated as ALO Orders. Conditional Orders and Firm-Up Orders may be designated as day or IOC. Additionally, subscribers may direct Conditional Orders and Firm-Up Orders to automatically cancel upon expiration of a time period specified by the ATS of one second or less ("Slow IOC Orders"). Conditional Orders and Firm-Up Orders must be pegged to the midpoint of the NBBO and may include an ultimate limit price. Subscribers may specify a minimum acceptable quantity ("MAQ") for orders submitted to the Conditional Cross. Display. The ATS does not display orders or trading interest entered into the Continuous Cross. In the Conditional Cross, where a Conditional Order is eligible to cross, whether with a Firm-Up Order or another Conditional Order, the ATS will systematically send a notice to the subscriber notifying it of the initial match (via FIX). Only direct Subscribers or the broker-dealer operator can receive invites messages. The invite message is a standard FIX execution report and contains the Client's Order ID, NFS Order ID, Leaves Quantity, Conditional Order Quantity, Conditional Order Limit Price, Side, Symbol, Invite Message Timestamp, Executing Broker, and a custom field indicating that the message is an invite message. There is no information pertaining to the counterparty or potential execution size. The subscriber will then have a system-determined time period of less than 1 second to "firm-up" by submitting a firm order, either manually or systematically, in response to the proposed match (such orders, "Firm-Up Orders"). No orders are eligible to route to other trading centers. Cancelling and replacing an order will result in a new time stamp. Standard Cross Order Interaction. The Standard Cross prioritizes orders based on the following factors, in the following order: (i) price and (ii) PWAP. Orders with the highest (buy) or lowest (sell) price have priority over lower (buy) or higher (sell) priced orders. When two or more orders, neither of which have price priority, may be executed at the same execution price, the order selected based on its PWAP has priority (see examples 2 through 3). An order's PWAP is a ranking provided by the ATS based on the percentage of shares to buy or sell that an order represents in a given security, at a given price. Upon receipt of an incoming order, the competing orders on the ATS are ranked, within the same price level, based on iterative, random selection. For example, if there were three buy orders in the ATS for a security at the same price level, order A with 5,000 shares, order B with 3,000 shares and order C with 2,000 shares, the probability that order A is selected first (and assigned priority at that price) is 50% (5,000 shares / total 10,000 shares at that price). The probabilities that orders B or C are selected first are 30% and 20%, respectively. If order A is selected first, the probabilities that orders B or C are selected second are 60% (3,000 shares / remaining 5,000 shares) and 40%, respectively. If order B is selected first, the probabilities that order A or C are selected second are 71% (5,000 shares / remaining 7,000 shares) and 29%, respectively. Please see examples 2 and 3. Example 1: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives limit order to buy 1,000 shares at $20.01. ATS receives limit order to buy 5,000 shares at $20.00. ATS receives limit order to sell 500 shares at $20.00. First buy limit order has limit price priority and receives fill of 500 shares at $20.01. Example 2: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives limit order A to buy 1,000 shares at $20.05. ATS receives limit order B to buy 5,000 shares at $20.05. ATS receives limit order to sell 500 shares at $20.05. Each buy order will be assigned a PWAP. Order A will have a 17% (1,000 shares / total shares of 6,000) chance of being randomly selected by the ATS and order B will have an 83% (5,000 shares / total shares of 6,000) chance of being randomly selected by the ATS. If order A is matched with the incoming order, order A will buy 500 shares. The remaining shares of orders A and B will be assigned a new PWAP to determine priority for any subsequent executions. Example 3: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives limit order to buy 1,000 shares at $20.05 (Order A). ATS receives limit order to buy 5,000 shares at $20.05 (Order B). ATS receives limit order to sell 500 shares at $20.05. Each buy order will be assigned a PWAP: Order A will have a 17% (1,000 shares / Total shares of 6,000) chance of being randomly selected by the ATS and Order B will have an 83% (5,000 shares / Total shares of 6,000) chance of being randomly selected by the ATS. Order B is matched with the sell order. ATS then receives limit order to sell 300 shares at $20.04. Each buy order will be assigned a PWAP. Order A will have an 18% (1,000 shares / total shares of 5,500) chance of being randomly selected by the ATS and Order B will have an 82% (4,500 shares / total shares of 5,500) chance of being randomly selected by the ATS. The ATS will match the sell order with whichever buy order has higher priority based on its PWAP. The remaining shares of orders A and B will be reassigned PWAPs. Where two orders may be matched, the order deemed to be removing liquidity will, subject to the terms of the orders and any applicable laws, rules or regulations, receive all available price improvement. Example 4: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives a day order with market pricing to buy. ATS then receives a day order with market pricing to sell. Orders are executed at $20.05. Example 5: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives a day order with market pricing to buy. ATS then receives a day order with limit pricing to sell at $20.02. Orders are executed at $20.05. Example 6: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives limit order to buy at $20.03. ATS then receives limit order to sell at $20.01. Orders are executed at $20.03. Example 7: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives a buy order pegged to the NBB, with discretion to the midpoint of the NBBO. ATS then receives a sell order pegged to midpoint of the NBBO. Orders are executed at $20.025. Example 8: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives a buy order pegged to the midpoint of the NBBO. ATS then receives a sell order pegged to the NBO, with discretion to the midpoint of the NBBO. Orders are executed at $20.025. Conditional Cross Order Interaction. The Conditional Cross prioritizes orders based on the following factors, in the following order: (i) price and (ii) order type, with Firm-Up Orders having priority over Conditional Orders. Amongst Firm-Up Orders on price parity, orders are prioritized based on the following factors, in the following order (a) tier, (b) size, and (c) time. Amongst Conditional Orders on price parity, orders are invited to firm-up based on the following factors, in the following order ("Invitation Logic"): (w) tier, (x) imbalance, (y) size and (z) time. Where two Firm-Up Orders are eligible to cross, the orders will be executed immediately at the midpoint of the NBBO. Where a Conditional Order is eligible to cross, whether with a Firm-Up Order or another Conditional Order, the ATS will send a notice to the subscriber notifying it of the initial match. The subscriber will then have a system-determined time period of less than 1 second to "firm-up" by submitting a firm order in response to the proposed match (such orders, "Firm-Up Orders"). The Firm-Up Order may include a different size, MAQ, time-in-force and/or ultimate limit price from the original Conditional Order. If each side of the proposed match, as relevant, submits a Firm-Up Order within the required time period, and provided that each side meets any specified MAQ associated with the contra-side order, the ATS will execute the orders at the midpoint of the NBBO at the time of execution (assuming the midpoint of the NBBO remains an eligible execution price). Orders entered into the Conditional Cross, including Firm-Up Orders, may only be executed against other orders in the Conditional Cross. Only Eligible Orders Matched. To the extent that any ATS order may not, by law, rule, regulation or the terms of the order, be crossed with another order, or may not be crossed at a particular price, then such orders will be ineligible for matching or the price adjusted to a permissible price. The ATS will apply the priorities detailed above with respect to eligible orders and prices only. In certain circumstances, orders may be ineligible to interact with certain other orders. The ATS will not execute any order outside the NBBO, except when the quotation being traded through is from an automated trading center to which the Firm has declared self-help. In each such instance, the ATS will disregard these quotations in determining the best bid or offer. The ATS accepts orders marked "short exempt" and may execute such orders at the NBB when a circuit breaker is in effect. Orders within the ATS are not eligible for routing to other Trading Centers.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

The Firm-Up Order may include a different size, MAQ, time-in-force and/or ultimate limit price from the original Conditional Order. If each side of the proposed match, as relevant, submits a Firm-Up Order within the firm-up window, and provided that each side meets any specified MAQ associated with the contra-side order, the ATS will execute the orders at the midpoint of the NBBO at the time of execution (assuming the midpoint of the NBBO remains an eligible execution price). Conditional Orders are cancelled by the system upon receipt of a corresponding Firm-Up order or at the expiry of the firm-up window. Submitting a Firm-Up order in response to an invite message may not result in an execution. For example, the ATS receives a Conditional Order to buy 10,000 shares (Buyer A). Then the ATS receives a Conditional Order to sell 10,000 shares (Seller A). Seller A and Buyer A will receive invite messages. Seller A submits a Firm-Up order for 10,000 shares and its Conditional Order is cancelled by the system. Buyer A does not submit a Firm-Up order. The firm-up window expires and Buyer A's Conditional Order is cancelled by the system. There is no execution. Seller A's Firm-Up order will remain executable in the system according to order instructions. For example, the ATS receives a Conditional Order to buy 10,000 shares (Buyer A) and a Conditional Order to buy 15,000 shares (Buyer B). Then the ATS receives a Conditional Order to sell 50,000 shares (Seller A). Seller A, Buyer A, and Buyer B will receive invite messages. Seller A submits a Firm-Up order for 50,000 shares and its Conditional Order is cancelled by the system. Buyer A then submits a Firm-Up order for 50,000 shares (larger than their Conditional Order of 10,000 shares) and its their Conditional Order is cancelled by the system. The system will execute the two Firm-Up orders immediately. Buyer B then responds to the invite message by submitting a Firm-Up order for 15,000 shares and its Conditional Order is cancelled by the system. Buyer B's Firm-Up order will receive no execution and will remain executable in the system. Orders entered into the Conditional Cross, including Firm-Up Orders, may only be executed against other orders in the Conditional Cross. NFS's algorithms and smart order router can enter Conditional and Firm-Up orders into the Conditional Cross. If an algorithm or smart order router submits a Conditional Order and subsequently receives an invite, it generally submits a corresponding Firm-Up order. The Firm-Up order may have a different limit price or quantity than the original Conditional Order depending on parent order urgency and market conditions. In some cases, the algorithm or smart order router may not submit a Firm-Up order due to a change in parent order urgency or market conditions from the time of invite.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

Explain the established, non-discretionary rules and procedures of the NMS Stock ATS, including order interaction rules for the priority, pricing methodologies, allocation, matching, and execution of orders and trading interest, and other procedures governing trading, such as price improvement functionality, price protection mechanisms, short sales, locked-crossed markets, the handling of execution errors, and the time-stamping of orders and executions.
	              </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">Standard Cross Order Interaction. The Standard Cross prioritizes orders based on the following factors, in the following order: (i) price and (ii) PWAP. Orders with the highest (buy) or lowest (sell) price have priority over lower (buy) or higher (sell) priced orders. When two or more orders, neither of which have price priority, may be executed at the same execution price, the order selected based on its PWAP has priority (see examples 2 through 3). An order's PWAP is a ranking provided by the ATS based on the percentage of shares to buy or sell that an order represents in a given security, at a given price. Upon receipt of an incoming order, the competing orders on the ATS are ranked, within the same price level, based on iterative, random selection. For example, if there were three buy orders in the ATS for a security at the same price level, order A with 5,000 shares, order B with 3,000 shares and order C with 2,000 shares, the probability that order A is selected first (and assigned priority at that price) is 50% (5,000 shares / total 10,000 shares at that price). The probabilities that orders B or C are selected first are 30% and 20%, respectively. If order A is selected first, the probabilities that orders B or C are selected second are 60% (3,000 shares / remaining 5,000 shares) and 40%, respectively. If order B is selected first, the probabilities that order A or C are selected second are 71% (5,000 shares / remaining 7,000 shares) and 29%, respectively. Please see examples 2 and 3. Example 1: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives limit order to buy 1,000 shares at $20.01. ATS receives limit order to buy 5,000 shares at $20.00. ATS receives limit order to sell 500 shares at $20.00. First buy limit order has limit price priority and receives fill of 500 shares at $20.01. Example 2: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives limit order A to buy 1,000 shares at $20.05. ATS receives limit order B to buy 5,000 shares at $20.05. ATS receives limit order to sell 500 shares at $20.05. Each buy order will be assigned a PWAP. Order A will have a 17% (1,000 shares / total shares of 6,000) chance of being randomly selected by the ATS and order B will have an 83% (5,000 shares / total shares of 6,000) chance of being randomly selected by the ATS. If order A is matched with the incoming order, order A will buy 500 shares. The remaining shares of orders A and B will be assigned a new PWAP to determine priority for any subsequent executions. Example 3: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives limit order to buy 1,000 shares at $20.05 (Order A). ATS receives limit order to buy 5,000 shares at $20.05 (Order B). ATS receives limit order to sell 500 shares at $20.05. Each buy order will be assigned a PWAP: Order A will have a 17% (1,000 shares / Total shares of 6,000) chance of being randomly selected by the ATS and Order B will have an 83% (5,000 shares / Total shares of 6,000) chance of being randomly selected by the ATS. Order B is matched with the sell order. ATS then receives limit order to sell 300 shares at $20.04. Each buy order will be assigned a PWAP. Order A will have an 18% (1,000 shares / total shares of 5,500) chance of being randomly selected by the ATS and Order B will have an 82% (4,500 shares / total shares of 5,500) chance of being randomly selected by the ATS. The ATS will match the sell order with whichever buy order has higher priority based on its PWAP. The remaining shares of orders A and B will be reassigned PWAPs. Where two orders may be matched, the order deemed to be removing liquidity will, subject to the terms of the orders and any applicable laws, rules or regulations, receive all available price improvement. Example 4: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives a day order with market order pricing to buy. ATS then receives market order to sell. Orders are executed at $20.05. Example 5: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives a day order with market order pricing to buy. ATS then receives limit order to sell at $20.02. Orders are executed at $20.05. Example 6: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives limit order to buy at $20.03. ATS then receives limit order to sell at $20.01. Orders are executed at $20.03. Example 7: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives a buy order pegged to the NBB, with discretion to the midpoint of the NBBO. ATS then receives a sell order pegged to midpoint of the NBBO. Orders are executed at $20.025. Example 8: NBBO is $20.00 x $20.05. ATS receives a buy order pegged to the midpoint of the NBBO. ATS then receives a sell order pegged to the NBO, with discretion to the midpoint of the NBBO. Orders are executed at $20.025. Conditional Cross Order Interaction. The Conditional Cross prioritizes orders based on the following factors, in the following order: (i) price and (ii) order type, with Firm-Up Orders having priority over Conditional Orders. Amongst Firm-Up Orders on price parity, orders are prioritized based on the following factors, in the following order (a) tier, (b) size, and (c) time. Amongst Conditional Orders on price parity, orders are invited to firm-up based on the following factors, in the following order ("Invitation Logic"): (w) tier, (x) imbalance, (y) size and (z) time. The Conditional Cross' tiers, in order of priority, are as follows: (i) NFS Agency and Channel SOR Orders (first priority, shared); (ii) Broker-Dealer Subscriber; and (iii) NFS Principal. Tiers assignments are non-discretionary; there is no method to override an assignment. Only Conditional Orders that have been invited to "firm-up," but have not yet submitted a response, have an imbalance. A Conditional Order's imbalance is equal to its total quantity minus the size of the contra-side order with which it matched. For example, assume that Subscriber A entered Conditional Order A for 50,000 shares, which matched with a contra-side Conditional Order for 10,000 shares. Conditional Order A would have an "imbalance" of 40,000 shares (total conditional quantity minus tentatively matched interest) until Subscriber A submits a Firm-Up Order in response (in which case the Firm-Up Order would be prioritized with other Firm Orders) or times-out. Where two Firm-Up Orders are eligible to cross, the orders will be executed immediately at the midpoint of the NBBO. Where a Conditional Order is eligible to cross, whether with a Firm-Up Order or another Conditional Order, the ATS will send a notice to the subscriber notifying it of the initial match. The invite message is a standard FIX execution report and contains the Client's Order ID, NFS Order ID, Leaves Quantity, Conditional Order Quantity, Conditional Order Limit Price, Side, Symbol, Invite Message Timestamp, Executing Broker, and a custom field indicating that the message is an invite message. There is no information pertaining to the counterparty or potential execution size. The subscriber will then have a system-determined time period of less than 1 second to "firm-up" by submitting a firm order in response to the proposed match (such orders, "Firm-Up Orders"). The Firm-Up Order may include a different size, MAQ, time-in-force and/or ultimate limit price from the original Conditional Order. If each side of the proposed match, as relevant, submits a Firm-Up Order within the required time period, and provided that each side meets any specified MAQ associated with the contra-side order, the ATS will execute the orders at the midpoint of the NBBO at the time of execution (assuming the midpoint of the NBBO remains an eligible execution price). Orders entered into the Conditional Cross, including Firm-Up Orders, may only be executed against other orders in the Conditional Cross. Only Eligible Orders Matched. To the extent that any ATS order may not, by law, rule, regulation or the terms of the order, be crossed with another order, or may not be crossed at a particular price, then such orders will be ineligible for matching or the price adjusted to a permissible price. The ATS will apply the priorities detailed above with respect to eligible orders and prices only. In certain circumstances, orders may be ineligible to interact with certain other orders. The ATS will not execute any order outside the NBBO, except when the quotation being traded through is from an automated trading center to which the Firm has declared self-help. In each such instance, the ATS will disregard these quotations in determining the best bid or offer. The ATS electronically creates and timestamps a record of each order receipt, execution and cancellation. The ATS does not match orders when the NMS NBBO is crossed. The ATS will not match orders when the market is locked unless subscribers have elected that their orders may interact during locked markets. The ATS will walk the book on a "one for one" basis and allocate executions in accordance with the priority described in the matching logic above. Each interaction is treated independently; (e.g. a removing order will match with the highest priority resting order, if unexecuted shares remain, the removing order will then interact with the next highest priority resting order, etc.). No orders are aggregated to meet MAQ. ATS systems actively monitor the market data for short sale restrictions and comply with the rules and regulations in place by preventing short sale executions of short sale restricted stocks at the bid of the NBBO. The Broker Dealer operator has an established process in place to comply with regulatory requirements for determining an error and any requisite account designation changes. If the broker dealer operator determines a trading error occurred as a result of ATS matching logic, or related electronic execution products, the portion of the execution done in error will be moved to the Firm's error account (principal account held at NFS) in accordance with the Firm's process and the customer's position will be corrected.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

In all such cases, a subscribers' ability to utilize a proposed Custom Counterparty Group is dependent on the Firm's willingness and ability to support such a proposed Custom Counterparty Group.

Generally these fees are based on the product used as opposed to the execution venue. In certain cases, NFS may negotiate a "cost plus" pricing structure. Under cost plus pricing, the client is responsible for paying all venue fees (ATS, exchange, etc.) incurred while trading through NFS trading products and a flat per share fee (irrespective of end venue).
