	            </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">General Background and Scope of Subscriber Confidential Trading Information:<br>The Broker-Dealer Operator operates the UBS ATS trading systems and is involved in the execution, processing, clearing, and settling of transactions executed in the UBS ATS.<br><br>UBS considers Subscriber confidential trading information (CTI) to consist of Subscribers' identities as well as Real-Time CTI and Post-Trade CTI (see below) relating to orders, trading interests, and executions in UBS ATS.<br><br>UBS does not consider information publicly disseminated pursuant to regulatory requirements (e.g., information that is reported to the consolidated tape pursuant to SRO trade reporting requirements, etc.), or information of an aggregated and anonymized nature (e.g., aggregated and anonymous order, trading interest, and execution statistics (see Part III, Item 26), advertisements, etc.) to be CTI.<br><br>For the purpose of this Form ATS-N, the term "Real-Time CTI" means order, trading interest, and execution information available for viewing in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides visibility to such information on a near real time basis.<br><br>Furthermore, for the purpose of this Form ATS-N, the term "Post-Trade CTI" means order, trading interest, and execution information available for viewing in either a database, log file, or report format solely after the event occurs (including canceled and expired orders) and the information is stored in its respective location and medium. The UBS ATS aggregates Post-Trade CTI across the entire ATS, by sector, by order type, by market capitalization, by size, by symbol or any other criteria deemed appropriate by the ATS Desk (see definition under ACE). The UBS ATS aggregates and anonymizes Post-Trade CTI on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis.<br><br>UBS administers access to CTI through a permission-based bank access system (the "Access System"). The Access System allows Persons to submit a request documenting a reason why the access to CTI is required. When a request is submitted, the Access System creates notifications for the line manager and ATS Supervisor to review the access request in the Access System and either approve or reject the request. Furthermore, the UBS ATS systems are physically segregated with dedicated permissions to the segregated trading environment.<br><br>Physical Separation:<br>The UBS ATS operates in an environment completely segregated (firewalled) from the Broker-Dealer Operator, its affiliates and all Subscribers. Due to this physical separation, access to the ATS environment is likewise segregated, maintained separately, and dedicated to the UBS ATS. Only those UBS Persons with pre-approved access may connect into the UBS ATS environment and only through dedicated remote access terminal servers using two-factor authentication. In addition, all UBS ATS servers and network equipment are located in segregated locked data center cages and cabinets, providing another layer of physical access security.<br><br>Employees with Access to Subscriber Confidential Trading Information:<br>Confidential trading information (CTI) is available to the UBS ATS Desk and shared employees described in Part II, Item 6.<br><br>While UBS' written safeguards and procedures apply to all UBS Persons, the following response is specific to UBS Persons who are employees of the ATS. For information on shared employees, please refer to the response to Part II, Item 6(a).<br><br>Safeguarding and Overseeing Subscriber Confidential Trading Information:<br>UBS maintains physical restrictions and policies and procedures designed to safeguard CTI from persons not authorized to receive or access such information. Persons are granted access to CTI for the sole purpose of operating the UBS ATS or ensuring the UBS ATS' compliance with applicable rules and regulations. UBS Persons are subject to the Cyber &amp; Information Security Policy (referred to as "The CIS Policy") restricting the use and disclosure of all confidential information, including CTI. Additionally, UBS' policies and procedures prohibit trading on material non-public information (see excerpt from UBS Personal Investments Policy below). Violations of these policies are punishable under UBS' Violation Policy, which may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. All Persons described in Part II, Item 6a have access to CTI.<br><br>UBS restricts access to systems that contain CTI through physical restrictions as well as policies and procedures. The aforementioned policies and procedures apply across all of UBS. Access to the UBS ATS dedicated environment and UBS ATS data, including CTI, requires appropriate permissions to prevent information leakage. Permissions and access are handled either through the Access System or by a separate supervisory approval (with consultation of Compliance and/or Legal if necessary). Unless noted otherwise, the ATS Supervisor or delegate must approve access to CTI. Access requests require approval by the UBS ATS Supervisor or delegate. In reviewing such access requests, the UBS ATS Supervisor or delegate considers factors including the individual's job function and responsibilities related to the UBS ATS. An access request will be denied if it is determined that the access requested is unnecessary or inappropriate. The UBS ATS Supervisor or delegate reviews access rights at least annually, makes the appropriate adjustments, and signs off on the access rights. During this process, permissions will be terminated if access is no longer required or appropriate. A request to remove access to CTI must be entered in the Access System by the ATS Supervisor, and the Access System will generate a notification to the Support team to action the removal request. On a weekly basis, the Access System compares approved permissions to configured permissions and generates notifications to the ATS Desk and the Support team to remove any non-approved permissions. Furthermore, as part of its leaver process, when a relevant person leaves the firm the Access System automatically generates a removal request to prompt the Support team to restrict all system access for the leaver (including access to UBS ATS and CTI). As part of its mover process, if an employee changes roles, the Access System automatically generates a required review notification to the ATS Supervisor or delegate. The Supervisor or delegate is required to review the permissions to determine whether they are still required. If the permissions are no longer required, the Supervisor or delegate will initiate the removal through the Access System and will follow the process described above.<br><br>Written Supervisory Procedures and Supervisory Controls:<br>The UBS ATS maintains Written Supervisory Procedures ("WSPs") with regards to access rights, confidential information (including CTI), and information barriers. On a monthly basis, these WSPs are reviewed by the ATS Supervisor or delegate and signed off through a supervisory control process in a bank standard tool. This tool is used to evidence the appropriate reviews, sign off, and evidence.<br><br>Personal Investments:<br>UBS maintains a Global Policy on Personal Investments (referred to as "The PI Policy") which is applicable to all UBS Persons. Furthermore, except where prohibited under local law, various provisions of The PI Policy also apply to individuals with a relationship to UBS Persons such as: spouse / domestic partner; minor children / step children; financial dependents; relatives who have shared the same household as the UBS Person for one year; or any other connected party whereby the UBS Person maintains direct influence over that party's investment or trading activity. The PI Policy applies throughout a UBS Person's employment lifecycle (including when former employees are on "gardening leave"), and certain prohibitions apply even after leaving UBS. In addition to all UBS employees' adherence to the UBS Code of Conduct and Ethics, The PI Policy provides the following standards for all UBS Persons: (i) disclosure of accounts; (ii) use of approved brokers; (iii) pre-approval requirements; (iv) holding periods; and (v) prohibited activities. These standards aim to: (i) ensure that UBS Persons avoid conflicts of interest when engaging in personal investment activity; (ii) prohibit misuse of sensitive information including CTI and any other unpublished price sensitive information; (iii) satisfy regulatory obligations including the disclosure of personal accounts and investment information; (iv) enable UBS and UBS Persons to avoid the appearance of impropriety; and (v) protect UBS's reputation.<br><br>UBS Persons are generally prohibited from trading single name instruments, including equities, bonds (including government bonds), any derivatives, structured notes or ETFs not broadly diversified as well as FX, commodities and precious metals.<br><br>Conduct Risk, a dedicated function behind information barriers, is responsible for defining an adequate monitoring and control framework and for the independent monitoring of adherence to The PI Policy. UBS maintains an operational risk framework assessment process to evaluate specific risks, and more broadly assess market and client impact. Conduct Risk also performs thematic reviews with the objective of identifying potential or actual conduct risks. Conduct Risk issues can be identified through various data and management information available from 1st Line of Defense and 2nd Line of Defense sources. The data and information is used to identify: (1) impact of any organizational drivers; (2) possible indicators of weak governance, oversight and supervision or poor risk culture; (3) whether individual behaviors or conduct are a potential indicator of a systemic issue; and (4) patterns or trends of emerging conduct risk issues.<br><br>Failure to comply with the requirements set out in The PI Policy may be subject a violator to the compliance violation framework as per the "Violations Policy" which may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. UBS Persons may also be subject to regulatory sanctions and civil or criminal penalties, or both.<br><br>Firm-wide Confidential Information Restrictions:<br>UBS subjects all personnel to firm-wide policies restricting the use and disclosure of confidential information, including confidential information relating to information of UBS ATS Subscribers. Additionally, firm-wide policies and procedures prohibit trading on the basis of material non-public information. Employees with access to CTI are provided additional training regarding the sensitivity of such information.<br><br>Systems with Access to Subscriber Confidential Trading Information:<br>The following systems within UBS have access to CTI:<br><br>ATS SYSTEMS: All direct trading systems of the UBS ATS have access to CTI, which includes systems such as the client facing proxies that Subscribers connect to and matching engines that process (and match) orders and CIs. Other ATS systems with access to CTI include the trade reporting and clearing system, risk and market access system, static database and publisher, real time monitoring system, and transactional databases.<br><br>-- CLIENT CONNECTIVITY PROXY: The UBS ATS proxy is the client connectivity layer to the UBS ATS that sits inside the ATS dedicated environment. Subscribers connect to one or more UBS ATS proxies to send messages to the UBS ATS. The UBS ATS proxy has access to CTI and that access is required to provide this functionality.<br><br>-- MATCHING ENGINES: The UBS ATS matching engine performs a process that receives Subscriber orders and CIs along with market data and other static information to make matching and Conditional Invitation decisions. The UBS ATS matching engine has access to CTI and that access is required to provide this functionality.<br><br>-- TRADE REPORTING AND CLEARING: The UBS ATS trade reporting system is designed to receive all ATS execution information and make the appropriate decisions, based on regulatory requirements, to report trades to a trade reporting facility. The UBS ATS trade reporting system also uses ATS information to submit all Class B Direct and Indirect Subscriber trades and certain Class A Indirect Subscriber trades for clearing via real-time QSR submission to DTCC on behalf of the Broker-Dealer Operator.<br><br>-- RISK AND MARKET ACCESS SYSTEM: The UBS ATS risk and market access system is a real time application that is designed to receive all ATS order and execution information and perform the necessary calculations and compare the output against each Subscriber's allowed credit limits. The risk and market access system uses this information to calculate the remaining value of credit available to a Subscriber, generate automated alerts, and send a control message to the client connectivity proxy to prevent trading in breach of a Subscriber's credit limit.<br><br>-- STATIC DATABASE AND PUBLISHER: The UBS ATS has a dedicated database in the segregated ATS environment that contains Subscriber static configuration information including but not limited to market access limits, risk checks, and trading configurations. Along with this database there is a publisher in the segregated ATS environment that reads the database and publishes the static data to the aforementioned ATS systems.<br><br>-- REAL TIME MONITORING: The UBS ATS Desk and Support use three different ATS real time monitoring applications to monitor the health of the UBS ATS. One system is specifically focused on order and execution information as well as Subscriber connectivity. The second system is specifically focused on system health and alerting. The third system is specifically focused on Subscriber and system latency monitoring. These tools use CTI such as Subscriber names and session information, market access limits, connectivity, as well as order and execution information to ensure proper performance of the UBS ATS. These systems contain CTI and are located within the segregated ATS environment, which is only accessible via segregated virtual desktops that access the dedicated and segregated environment.<br><br>-- TRANSACTIONAL DATABASE: The UBS ATS maintains multiple databases containing CTI relating to transactions executed in the UBS ATS. Access to these databases is restricted to the UBS ATS Desk and the shared employees discussed in Part II, Item 6a. Those individuals with access to CTI use this information to run queries, generate reports (as described in the beginning of Part II, Item 6a), investigate historic trading activity, and for other bona fide purposes.<br><br>NON-ATS SYSTEMS: Non-ATS systems with access to CTI in the normal course of business include systems that either send orders and trading interest to the UBS ATS or systems that perform a service for the UBS ATS but are not dedicated to the ATS.<br><br>-- ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM: UBS' order management system (OMS), including the UBS algorithmic platform (UBS Algo) and UBS Smart Order Router (SOR), transmit CTI to the extent orders are routed to the ATS. This system communicates information to personnel within UBS that have the appropriate permissions to view the orders sent to the UBS ATS and identifies the Trading Center(s) to which clients' orders were routed and/or executed, including the UBS ATS. The only CTI that is available in this instance of the system is for Class A Direct and Indirect Subscribers. Class B Direct and Indirect Subscriber CTI will never be passed back to this system.<br><br>-- CLIENT CONNECTIVITY PROXY: The Broker-Dealer Operator has a system for managing the client connectivity layer that is separate from that of the UBS ATS. The Broker-Dealer Operator's client connectivity system is specifically dedicated to clients of the Broker-Dealer Operator and sits outside the segregated UBS ATS environment. The only CTI that is available in this instance of the system is for Class A Direct and Indirect Subscribers. Class B Direct and Indirect Subscriber CTI will never be passed back to this system.<br><br>-- REAL TIME MONITORING: The Broker-Dealer Operator has a real time monitoring system for all clients of the Broker-Dealer Operator that is specifically focused on order and execution information. This system resides in the Broker-Dealer Operators environment and not inside the UBS ATS. It provides a view into order and execution information for clients across all trading venues, including the UBS ATS, and is permissioned by desk/role so that client information and CTI are only viewable by the appropriate employees. The only CTI that is available in this instance of the system is for Class A Direct and Indirect Subscribers. Class B Direct and Indirect Subscriber CTI will never be passed back to this system.<br><br>-- TRANSACTIONAL DATABASE: The Broker-Dealer Operator maintains multiple databases containing CTI relating to transactions executed in the UBS ATS. These databases are not solely dedicated to the UBS ATS and contain order and execution information for all clients of the Broker-Dealer Operator. These databases will only contain CTI for Class A Direct and Indirect Subscribers. Class B Direct and Indirect Subscriber CTI will never be stored in these databases.<br><br>-- THIRD PARTY TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM: UBS offers a third-party direct market access platform to clients of the Broker-Dealer Operator that are Class A Indirect Subscribers to transmit orders and/or CIs to UBS ATS. This platform communicates to employees of the third-party responsible for managing the platform real-time information about where Subscribers' orders and/or CIs were routed and executed, which could be the UBS ATS or any other market center.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

	             </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The following order and CI types are offered by the UBS ATS:<br><br>-- Pegged Orders and CIs - A pegged order may be pegged to the near, midpoint, or far side of the national best bid or offer (NBBO), and may be executed at any price at or within the NBBO. Pegged orders may optionally have a limit price.<br><br>-- Limit Orders and CIs - An order to buy or sell a stated amount of a security at a specified price or better. A marketable limit order is a limit order to buy (sell) at or above (below) the lowest (highest) Protected Offer (Bid) for the security.<br><br>-- Market Orders - An order to buy or sell a stated amount of a security that is to be executed at or better than the NBBO at the time the order reaches the UBS ATS. Market Orders are treated the same as market Pegged Orders.<br><br><br>i. The priority of an order is determined first by its effective price, and next by the time of receipt by the UBS ATS. The priority of a Conditional Indication (CI) is determined by its effective price, then by its quantity, and then by its time of receipt by the UBS ATS. For priority purposes, the effective price of an order or CI is defined based on its type:<br><br>-- For Pegged Orders and CIs: The effective price is considered to be the less aggressive of the limit price (if provided) and the pegged price (near, mid, or far). For midpeg orders, there is an additional option, 'PeggedMidpointMode', which is described below.<br><br>-- For Limit Orders and CIs: The effective price is considered to be the limit price.<br><br>In all cases, the effective price of an order or CI will not be allowed to exceed the far price (i.e., for buy orders or CIs, the NBO, and for sell orders or CIs, the NBB). Limit orders or CIs with limit prices that exceed the far price (i.e., marketable limit order or CI) will be treated as though they are at equivalent prices (i.e., the far price) for priority purposes.<br><br>An order will be matched with the highest priority order(s) that would not violate any crossing restrictions. So, for example, the highest priority buy order may cross against the second-highest priority sell order if there is a crossing restriction on the highest priority buy order or the highest priority sell order that prevents crossing between those two orders.<br><br>All modifications of orders and CIs processed by UBS will cause an order or CI to lose its original time priority. The time priority of a modified order or CI will correspond to the time when the modified order or CI is received by the UBS<br>ATS. In all cases, the timestamp used by the UBS ATS is measured in microseconds.<br><br>When two orders are matched in the UBS ATS, they will be matched at the earlier received order's effective price ("Price Determining Order"), which may be modified based on the LULD bands for execution, but not for priority purposes.<br><br>Upon receiving an order, or upon a market data update, the UBS ATS will attempt to match orders. After that process completes, the UBS ATS will then combine and sort all remaining orders and CIs according to priority (order priority is price/time and CI priority is price/size/time) to generate invitations to CIs (an "Invite" or "Invitation").<br><br>Invites will only be generated if the Invite would not violate any crossing restrictions (e.g., minimum quantity, Source Category restrictions, conditional invite grade restriction, etc.).<br><br>ii. If the Price Determining Order's limit price is more aggressive than the far band, and the relevant band is inside the NBBO, the effective price will be either adjusted to be equal to the far band for Price Determining Orders that are Limit Orders or excluded from execution consideration for Price Determining Orders that are Pegged Orders.<br><br>iii. The UBS ATS does not currently support an order type designed solely for the purpose of not removing liquidity.<br><br>iv. The UBS ATS supports Pegged Orders and Pegged CIs, which may or may not have a limit price. For the avoidance of doubt, the priority of a Pegged Order or CI can be determined either by the limit price, or the peg price, depending on which price is less aggressive. Therefore, two Pegged Orders or CIs pegged to the same price but with different limit prices may have different priority based on where the limit prices are with respect to the pegged price.<br><br>PeggedMidPointMode: The UBS ATS supports two variants of midpoint Pegged Orders or CIs: (1) FillToLimit (default), and (2) FillToMidpoint. For orders, the variant only affects execution price if the limit price on the order is less aggressive than the midpoint (i.e., a buy order with a limit price below the midpoint or a sell order with a limit price above the midpoint). If FillToLimit is selected, these orders may fill away from the midpoint, whereas orders with FillToMidpoint selected will not. For CIs, the variant affects whether an Invite can be generated.<br><br>v. The UBS ATS does not route orders or CIs to other trading centers.<br><br>vi. The UBS ATS accepts orders with an instruction that the order post within the UBS ATS until executed, canceled, or expired at day's end ("Day Orders") or with an instruction that the order be immediately crossed with other orders in the UBS ATS or cancelled ("IOC Orders"). CIs can only be sent as Day Orders because IOC Orders are not supported.<br><br>vii. The UBS ATS does not support replacing the order type of an order or CI.<br><br>viii. UBP does not support the sending of market peg orders or CIs. Both market pegged orders and CIs are supported via FIX 4.2.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

An Invite message is represented as an Unsolicited Cancel Execution Report (FIX 4.2 Tag 35=8 and Tag 39=4). The Invite is sent to the sender of the CI by the UBS ATS to notify them that an eligible contra (i.e. CI or order) is present.<br><br>Upon receipt of the Invite, the CI sender is expected to respond to an Invite message by sending a Day Order (a "Firm-Up Order") (NewOrderSingle, FIX 4.2 Tag 35=D) message to the UBS ATS with a reference to the Invite ID in the Invite message. The Firm-Up Order may be for a quantity different than the quantity of the CI (although UBS reasonably expects Firm-Up Orders to be at least equal to the minimum executable quantity) and should be received by UBS within 100 milliseconds. While the UBS ATS will still accept Firm-Up orders received more than 100 milliseconds after the Invite was sent, for scoring purposes a late response will be considered as not responding at all.

A Score will be assigned based on consideration of these measurements. A new sender of CIs that has not been previously assigned a Score will be categorized as Medium during an initial phase, and a new Score (which may be the same or different) will be assigned when the requisite evaluation is performed.<br><br>At any time in its reasonable discretion, UBS ATS through an ad-hoc or regularly scheduled governance meeting may revise a Score by changing it to a lower category (i.e. from High to Medium).

Once a match occurs, the UBS ATS sends electronic messages containing execution reports to the sender of the order.<br><br>EXECUTION TIME STAMPS: The matching engine assigns an execution timestamp to specify the time at which an order (or part of an order) is executed. The sequence of each execution timestamp may vary slightly from the sequence of actual execution times recorded in the matching engine due to the parallel processing of messages through multiple paths.  Despite any such variation in sequencing, the execution time recorded in the matching engine is determinative.  If Subscribers seek information to confirm that order priority was respected, UBS ATS will reasonably, on a best-efforts basis, make available the actual execution times recorded in the matching engine to demonstrate order priority was honored.<br><br>NBBO on EXECUTIONS: In the event a match occurs, the UBS ATS will record the NBBO and LULD bands at the time of match.<br><br>LOCKED/CROSSED MARKETS: The UBS ATS will not execute a transaction if the NBBO is either locked or crossed.<br><br>PARTIAL EXECUTION: If only a partial execution of an IOC Order occurs, the remainder will be cancelled.

The UBS ATS will accept orders outside of the LULD bands; however, it will not execute if the effective match price were to be outside of the LULD bands.<br><br>ERRORS and CLEARLY ERRONEOUS EXECUTIONS: The UBS ATS handles execution errors in accordance with the Global Equities Handbook (the "Handbook"). The Handbook requires notification of errors to the relevant Supervisor, and applies the standards of the risk management framework. The UBS ATS will determine a course of action based on the facts and circumstances surrounding such errors. For instance, one or both sides of the trade could be cancelled. The UBS ATS will apply the same standard of review to potentially clearly erroneous executions ("CEEs") as set forth in the applicable rules of the self-regulatory organizations. Following a determination of a CEE by the primary market, UBS ATS will cancel both sides of any match impacted by the CEE determination. Additionally, requests for the UBS ATS to review a potential CEE must be submitted to the UBS ATS via email (submitted to ats@ubs.com) within 30 minutes of the subject match.<br><br>PRINCIPAL NO SELF-MATCH: The UBS ATS will not effect a match when both sides of the potential match are principal orders from the same legal entity of a Class B Direct or Class B Indirect Subscriber.<br><br>MINIMUM QUANTITY: Orders may be routed to the UBS ATS with a minimum quantity value specified; the quantity may be managed by Subscribers on an order-by-order basis. When a minimum quantity is used, the UBS ATS will only perform a match if the specified number of shares or greater are available from a single eligible contra side order. By default, when the leaves quantity on an order becomes smaller than the specified minimum quantity, the minimum quantity constraint will no longer be in effect. Subscribers have the ability to change that behavior by sending a specific MinQuantityLeaveMode value in the order message. The available options are to have the leaves quantity become the minimum quantity or the order can be cancelled.

It is calculated by looking at the mid-to-mid reversion against Source Category 3 Anchor Set flow, as described below.<br>--  Source Category 3 Eligibility Reversion: This determines whether a Subscriber Flow is eligible to be categorized as Source Category 3.

Class B Subscriber Flow is re-evaluated for inclusion in the Anchor Set on a monthly basis by reviewing executions during the Review Period. The first step of the process of constructing the Anchor Set for a given Review Period involves identifying the Class B Anchor Set Candidate Flow, which consists of all Class B Subscribers that have been assigned to Source Category 3 for the entirety of the Review Period. The Anchor Set is then constructed using the UBS Algo Flow, and some or all of the Class B Anchor Set Candidate Flow such that all Class B Subscriber Flow in the Anchor Set has an Anchor Set Eligibility Reversion of less than or equal to 10(percent) (in other words, all Class B Subscriber Flow in the Anchor Set has an aggregate mid-to-mid reversion against the rest of the Anchor Set that is less than or equal to 10(percent) and has also been categorized as Source Category 3 for the entirety of the Review Period). If a Class B Subscriber is included in the Anchor Set for a given Review Period, it is kept in Source Category 3 and will be re-evaluated for continued inclusion in the Anchor Set at the next monthly review<br><br>Order flow not received from the UBS SOR that is not in the Anchor Set, but is categorized as being in Source Category 3 or Source Category 4 at the time of the current monthly review is then evaluated for subsequent inclusion in Source Category 3 by looking at the Source Category 3 Eligibility Reversion, which is defined as the more impactful of the following two metrics:<br>--  The Subscriber's mid-to-mid reversion against all Anchor Set flow where the Anchor Set is willing to interact with Source Category 4, as determined by the crossing restriction on the Anchor Set order. (Note that, as described in Part III Item 14, of all Anchor Set flow, only the UBS Algos are able to restrict crossing against Source Category 4.)<br>--  A blended reversion looking at the Subscriber's executions against all Anchor Set flow, where the exec-to-mid metric is used when the Anchor Set order is a Midpeg Day Order, and the mid-to-mid metric is used otherwise.<br><br>Additional elements of the reversion analysis:<br>--  Material outliers are excluded from the analysis.<br>--  Any execution where either side is a Firm-Up in response to a Conditional Invitation is excluded from the analysis.<br>--  Measurement is based on a notional weighted average over a trailing three (3) month period.<br>--  The analysis considers both Day and IOC Orders<br>--  When a Subscriber Flow is moved to a less restrictive Source Category (e.g., from Source Category 5, to Source Category 4), to remain in the new Source Category the Subscriber Flow's reversion metrics must meet the thresholds described below for its first month in the new Source Category as well as for the entirety of the Review Period. In subsequent months, only the reversion during the Review Period is considered.  For example, if a Subscriber Flow is in Source Category 5, and its Source Category 4 Eligibility Reversion is less than 25% for the current Review Period, and it is moved into Source Category 4, its Source Category 4 Eligibility Reversion must be less than 25% for its first month in Source Category 4 in addition to the normal Review Period. After the first month in Source Category 4, the Source Category 4 Eligibility Reversion would be allowed to exceed 25% as long as the Reversion for the duration of the Review Period is still less than 25%.<br><br>A revision to Source Category can only move lower one grade at a time (e.g., from Source Category 5 to Source Category 4, or from Source Category 4 to Source Category 3)<br><br>At any time in its reasonable discretion, UBS ATS management may revise a Source Category for any Subscriber Flow regardless of grading eligibility by changing it to a higher grade (e.g., from Source Category 3 to Source Category 4).

The No Self Cross restriction can be  configured at the UBS ATS upon request to prevent self-crossing  across multiple flow identifying names ("Family Group"). It can  also be managed by the Subscriber on an order-by-order basis  within the same flow identifying name. However, no self cross is  always assumed to have been sent if the flow identifying name is<br>in a Family Group.<br><br>--  No UBS Principal: To prevent crossing against UBS Principal Orders or CIs; managed by Subscribers on an order-by-order basis.<br><br>--  Round Lot Only: To prevent crossing in other than round lot  quantities; managed by Subscribers on an order-by-order basis.<br><br>--  PeggedMidPointMode: The UBS ATS supports two variants of  midpoint Pegged Orders or CIs: (1) FillToLimit (default), and (2) FillToMidpoint. For orders, the variant only affects execution  price if the limit price on the order is less aggressive than the  midpoint (i.e., a buy order with a limit price below the midpoint or a sell order with a limit price above the midpoint). If FillToLimit is selected, these orders may fill away from the  midpoint, whereas orders with FillToMidpoint selected will not. For CIs, the variant may affect if an Invite can be generated.<br><br>--  Enable Conditionals: To enable a Day Order to interact with Conditional Indications; this crossing restriction can be managed by Subscribers on an order-by-order basis.<br><br>--  Minimum Quantity: Orders and CIs may be sent to the UBS ATS  with a minimum quantity value specified, and managed by Subscribers on an order-by-order basis. When used, UBS ATS will  only match or generate an Invite when at least the specified  number of shares is available from a single eligible contra side  order or CI. By default, when the leaves quantity on an order  becomes smaller than the specified minimum quantity, the minimum  quantity constraint will no longer be in effect. Subscribers have  the ability to change that behavior by sending a specific MinQuantityLeaveMode value in the order message. The available  options are to have the leaves quantity become the minimum  quantity or the order can be cancelled. In the latter case, an  unsolicited cancel message is sent to the sender of the order and  the order is removed from the ATS book.<br><br>Restricting Crossing Against a Specific Source Category<br><br>The below crossing restrictions may be sent to the UBS ATS by each Subscriber on an order by order basis by sending the appropriate crossing restriction value on each order, or by the UBS SOR on behalf of the Subscriber.
