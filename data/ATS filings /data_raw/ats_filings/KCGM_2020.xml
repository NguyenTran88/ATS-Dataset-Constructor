The Firm<br>operates POSIT on a matching engine that runs on a standalone server in the NY5 Data Center.<br>See Part I, Item 7; and Part III, Item 6(a).  The POSIT matching engine communicates with<br>shared systems to book trades, to report executed trades to the tape, to facilitate clearance and<br>settlement, for financial reporting and billing, and to facilitate other post-trade processes.  The<br>Firm operates the Alert application on servers that are separate from the POSIT matching engine.<br>These systems contain Confidential Information.  See Part II, Item 6 for information on<br>personnel that have access to Confidential Information.<br>AGGREGATED ANONYMOUS DATA.  Data which has been aggregated and which does not<br>identify any Subscribers is not Confidential Information ("Aggregated Anonymous Data").  The<br>Firm publishes firm-wide aggregated anonymous execution data to market wide trade<br>advertisement systems after the transaction has been reported to the consolidated tape.  The data<br>does not include any client identities but does include symbol level executed volumes.  While the<br>Firm does not consider this data to be Confidential Information, it does not include POSIT<br>Aggregated Anonymous Data in these reports.<br>The Firm posts monthly statistics on its website and disseminates this data to Subscribers ("the<br>Monthly POSIT and Alert Statistics").  The Monthly POSIT and Alert Statistics are available at<br>https://www.virtu.com/about/transparency and provide aggregate and anonymous information<br>about POSIT and Alert, including total volume; volume by sector; volume by market cap; fill<br>size distribution; distribution of Alert block size, and distribution of executions at the bid, mid<br>and offer.  The Firm produces market commentary from time-to-time that discusses general<br>market trends.  The statistical data described in this paragraph can be used to produce market<br>commentary.  The Firm considers this data to be Aggregated Anonymous Data and not<br>Confidential Information.  The Firm does not permit Subscribers to opt out of having their data<br>included in these reports.<br>SALES DATA.  Sales Data is aggregated information about the products and services the Firm's<br>clients use and includes the client's name, the product or service they use, aggregate executed<br>volume, and revenues ("Sales Data").  Sales Data includes aggregated ATS data as described in<br>the preceding sentence.  The Firm provides Sales Data to management personnel, Sales or<br>Trading personnel, Relationship Management personnel and Alert Sales and Coverage personnel<br>who are involved in handling relationships with the Firm's clients.  Sales Data is provided for the<br>purpose of allowing these personnel to keep abreast of the client's business activities to manage<br>the client relationship and to cross sell the Firm's products and services to the client.  The Firm<br>does not consider Sales Data to be Confidential Information when distributed internally for the<br>above described purposes.  The Firm makes this information available in end of day reports and<br>in sales systems (i.e., systems that support activities of Sales or Trading personnel, Relationship<br>Management personnel and Alert Sales and Coverage personnel for the purposes described<br>above) on T+1.  The Firm prohibits personnel from disclosing Sales Data to third parties.  The<br>Firm does not permit Subscribers to opt out of having this data made available to personnel<br>involved handling client relationships, as defined in Part II, Item 6(a).<br>PERSONNEL WITH ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The Firm does not<br>have any personnel whose sole responsibility is for the operations of POSIT.  The shared<br>personnel discussed in response to Part II, Item 6(a), have access to Confidential Information.<br>SAFEGUARDS AND OVERSEEING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The Firm maintains<br>written policies and procedures regarding use and protection of Confidential Information.  Firm<br>personnel are subject to its parent, Virtu Financial Inc.'s Code of Conduct and Employee Manual.<br>Firm personnel are also subject to the Firm's Information Security Policy, Compliance Manual,<br>and Written Supervisory Procedures.<br>These policies prohibit the personnel listed in Part II, Item 6(a), from sharing Confidential<br>Information with other personnel who are not in one of these permitted categories or with any<br>other person.  The exception is that Compliance and Legal personnel may provide information to<br>regulators in response to regulatory requests or to third parties pursuant to subpoena.  Personnel<br>who violate the Firm's policies concerning Confidential Information are subject to discipline,<br>including termination of their employment.  The Firm performs email reviews and employs data<br>loss software as a means of safeguarding Confidential Information.<br>The Firm procedures require that personnel make requests for access to its systems through the<br>Firm's access ticketing system and to receive approval from a supervisor prior to being granted<br>access to any systems.  The Firm's supervisory personnel grant access to systems on the premise<br>that it is necessary to perform their duties and to carry out the purpose for which the information<br>is provided to them.  The supervisor responsible for POSIT and Alert approves requests for<br>access to the POSIT matching engine and Alert application.  The Firm only permits approved<br>personnel in the categories described in Part II, Item 6(a), to have access to Confidential<br>Information and only permits these personnel to access the systems and the Confidential<br>Information contained therein using approved means of access and credentials.  Supervisors do<br>not grant access to Confidential Information. The Firm maintains a process that sends<br>notifications to designated personnel to disable systems access for personnel who are no longer<br>employed by the Firm.  Supervisors are responsible for instructing the technology personnel to<br>disable access when employees change roles.  The Firm provides reports to the supervisors that<br>show personnel with access to the POSIT matching engine and Alert application on a monthly<br>basis.  Supervisors review these reports to ensure that these personnel still require access to carry<br>out responsibilities related to the ATS.<br>PERSONAL TRADING RESTRICTIONS.  The Firm maintains employee trading policies that<br>require personnel to disclose their own personal accounts and the accounts of close family<br>members, that prohibit personnel from trading based on any client Confidential Information, that<br>require personnel to pre-clear transactions and attest at the time of trade entry that they are not<br>trading on Confidential Information, and that prescribe holding periods for securities purchases.<br>The Firm conducts reviews of employee trading to determine whether trades were pre-cleared<br>and whether holding periods were observed.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

For Broker-Dealers the<br>Firm doesn't have a specific net capital requirement, but will consider the nature of the business<br>flow, whether there will be large mark-to-market exposures, anticipated revenues provide<br>sufficient risk vs. reward ratios, whether the Subscriber is part of a larger group and there are<br>explicit or implicit guarantees. For non-Broker-Dealers that do not meet one of the criteria to be<br>defined as an Institutional Investor, exceptions may be granted is there is a degree of confidence<br>the company will grow and meet the definition of institutional investor in the future.  The<br>Product Manager for the ATS approves or denies access to the ATS.

Alert is an anonymous<br>Conditional Order matching application that exists outside of the POSIT matching engine.<br>Alert has two types of participants: Human Participants and Electronic Participants.  Alert has<br>three message types: A Conditional Order; an Invitation to Firm-Up; and a Firm-Up Response<br>Order.<br>Human Participants install Alert software, which can be installed on a variety of OMS or EMS<br>systems, on their systems.  The Alert software takes in information about Human Participants<br>orders resident in the OMS or EMS and transmits that information to the Alert matching<br>application in the form of a Conditional Order.  Alert Human Participants configure the<br>frequency at which the Alert software takes in information about orders resident in their OMS or<br>EMS.  The Alert software also provides Alert participants with a graphical user interface ("the<br>Alert Front End") that allows users to see pending Conditional Orders and respond to Invitations<br>to Firm-Up. Human Participants can manually respond to Firm-Up Requests or configure the<br>Alert software to automatically respond.  For Human Participants, Alert will send the Invitation<br>to Firm-Up to the Alert Front End via a pop up window, requesting the Human Participant to<br>Firm-Up.  The pop up window indicates that a contra order exists in a given symbol, but does not<br>provide any size or price information of the contra order.

The Alert software will<br>the send a Firm-Up Response Order from the Human Participant's EMS to VAL for submission<br>to the POSIT ATS Alert Crossing Session that references the invitation and matches the<br>attributes of the invitation in terms of symbol, side and quantity. Human Participants can change<br>order quantities up or down prior to submitting a Firm-Up Response.  VAL's agency desks and<br>clients of its Affiliates cannot use the Alert Front End to view and interact with conditional<br>interests.  They are Electronic Participants and can only send orders to algorithms that can send<br>Conditional Orders through Alert.<br>Electronic Participants do not install Alert software.  Rather, Electronic Participants transmit<br>Conditional Orders directly to the Alert matching application through the Electronic<br>Participant's algorithm or electronic system.   Alert will send an Invitation to Firm-Up to the<br>algorithm or system that entered a Conditional Order when a potential matching opportunity<br>exists.  Hereinafter, Electronic Participant and algorithm or system shall have the same<br>meaning.  For an execution to occur, the Electronic Participant must respond to the invitation<br>by transmitting a Firm-Up Response Order.  Alert will transmit an Invitation to Firm-Up to the<br>Electronic Participant containing the same number of shares included in the Electronic<br>Participant's original Conditional Order.  The Electronic Participant may then respond by<br>sending a Firm-Up Response Order to VAL for submission to the POSIT ATS Alert Crossing<br>Session that references the invitation and matches the attributes of the invitation in terms of<br>symbol, side and quantity.  The Electronic Participant may transmit a Firm-Up Response Order<br>with a quantity that is less or more than the invited quantity.  An execution will occur to the<br>extent that Firm-Up Response Orders are received by POSIT within the designated response<br>time, subject to other instructions placed on the orders by the participant, as described in Part III<br>item 7.  All business units and affiliates of the broker dealer operator that enter or direct the<br>entry of orders into POSIT ALERT are considered Electronic Participants, and are not treated<br>any differently than Electronic Participants external to the broker dealer operator.<br>When multiple Conditional Orders are present on the same side and same symbol, the Alert<br>matching application will give invitation priority in the following order: Human Participant<br>with Auto-Ex enabled, Human Participant without Auto-Ex enabled, Electronic Participant.<br>When two participants are on the same side and fall within the same participant type (i.e., two<br>Human Participants with Auto-Ex enabled, two Human Participants without Auto-Ex enabled,<br>or two Electronic Participants), the Alert matching application will use order size as the second<br>order of invitation priority.  For example, if two Human Participants are present on the same<br>side and same symbol, and a single contra order is submitted, the Human Participant with the<br>largest order size will receive an invitation message.  Lastly, if two participants are on the same<br>side, fall within the same participant type, and have the same order size, order submission time<br>will be used as the third order of priority to determine which participant would receive the<br>invitation.<br>The response time to the Invitation to Firm-Up is a function of the type of participants invited.<br>Electronic Participants must respond within 1 second, while Human Participants without Auto-<br>Ex enabled have 30 seconds to respond.  Participants who do not respond within these time<br>frames will not be eligible to participate in the match.<br>Alert invites all participants in the potential match simultaneously, except as described below.<br>When an Electronic Participant has a potential match against a Human Participant, the Human<br>Participant will receive the Invitation to Firm-Up first.  Once the Human Participant firms up,<br>an Invitation to Firm-Up is then sent to the Electronic Participant.  If the Human Participant<br>does not firm up, the Electronic Participant will not receive an Invitation to Firm-Up.<br><br>In addition to the messaging described above to Alert participants, Alert will transmit<br>information to POSIT on the potential Alert match.  At the time Invitations to Firm-Up are sent<br>to participants, Alert sends the following information to POSIT on the potential Alert match: 1)<br>Number of buyers, 2) Number of sellers, 3) Number of Human Participants, 4) Symbol, 5)<br>Response timer.  POSIT will run the match at the earlier of when all participants submit firm up<br>orders to POSIT or the expiration of the response timer.<br>After the completion of the match, or the expiration of the response timer, POSIT will transmit<br>information on the outcome of the match back to Alert.  This information is stored to log files<br>that are consumed by a front end application called Phoenix.  Phoenix is used by Alert Sales and<br>Coverage personnel to monitor client orders in Alert, as described in Part II, Item 6a.<br>Upon request, POSIT will apply a maximum notional value constraint, set by the Alert<br>participant, to an Alert participant's order. In addition, upon request, POSIT will aggregate an<br>Alert participant's orders for execution. Where such Alert orders have a common MEQ<br>instruction, POSIT will apply the MEQ instruction on the aggregated Alert order.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

Note, the rules and procedures<br>applicable to the Continuous Crossing Session apply to the other crossing sessions unless<br>otherwise stated.  Subscribers can specify which session to route an order to via a specific FIX<br>tag.  POSIT's methodology for crossing is that priority is based on price and then eligible orders<br>receive allocations based on a pro rata split, as described in Part III, Item 7a.  If shares cannot be<br>evenly split on a pro rata basis, then POSIT will randomly choose an order to receive a smaller<br>allocation.<br>POSIT reserves the right to review any transaction based upon the request of a Subscriber or on<br>its own motion and declare any transaction executed by POSIT null and void in the event that the<br>transaction occurred at a price that was within the numerical guidelines for erroneous<br>transactions of any exchange or was the result of a significant systems disruption.  In reviewing<br>transactions resulting from significant systems disruptions, in addition to the price of the<br>transactions, POSIT may also take into account the volume of transactions as compared to the<br>normal volume of transactions for the relevant security as executed by POSIT.  POSIT reserves<br>the right to use its discretion to provide price accommodations in circumstances that are not<br>clearly errors or erroneous transactions but where the circumstances are appropriate, such as<br>minor systems latency, to make a price adjustment as an accommodation to an affected client(s).<br>In these scenarios, the Firm performs an analysis to determine the appropriate price and any<br>profit or loss as a result of the adjustment is incurred by VAL.<br>Below are descriptions of the Continuous Crossing Session, the Agency Close Crossing Session,<br>and the Alert Crossing Session.<br>      Continuous Crossing Session<br>During the Continuous Crossing Session, Subscribers may only enter orders that are Peg or IOC<br>order types.  Peg orders can be submitted to POSIT beginning at 8:00 a.m. and through the<br>trading day until the market closes at 4:00 p.m. and are held in POSIT's order book until they are<br>executed, cancelled or until they expire.  When a Peg order is submitted to POSIT, the system<br>scans for available liquidity to determine whether there is a contra-side Peg order residing in the<br>system.  If there is no contra-side Peg order in POSIT, the Peg order will continue to rest in<br>POSIT until executed or cancelled and returned. Peg orders in POSIT will execute immediately<br>with contra-side IOC orders, unless one of the orders' instructions make it ineligible for<br>execution.  Peg orders can be executed against contra-side Peg orders and/or IOC orders;<br>however, IOC orders can only be executed against Peg orders.  POSIT cancels unexecuted Peg<br>orders in accordance with the instructions of the submitting Subscriber, or by default at the close<br>of regular trading in the market. If a Peg order expires without being fully or partially filled, the<br>Subscriber submitting that order receives a "nothing done" report. IOC orders are immediately<br>executed or immediately canceled upon receipt.  For Subscribers' orders that partially executed<br>during the Continuous Crossing Session, the residual shares will be cancelled back to the<br>Subscriber after the close of trading.<br>POSIT only executes orders at the midpoint of the NBBO, the NBO or the NBB.  In the first<br>instance, POSIT will attempt to cross eligible orders at the midpoint of the NBBO.  If midpoint<br>pricing is unavailable, POSIT will then look to other matching opportunities at the NBB or NBO,<br>as applicable.<br>Subscribers accessing POSIT directly can request that POSIT apply certain default instructions<br>or attributes to the Subscriber's orders submitted to POSIT, as described in Part III, Item 7(a),<br>and Part III, Item 14a.<br>POSIT will execute crosses at prices within the permissible price bands established under the<br>Limit Up - Limit Down Plan.  POSIT is programmed to prevent executions outside of the Limit<br>Up ? Limit Down price bands.<br>Subscribers can include MEQ instructions on their orders. In that event, POSIT will not execute<br>the order in an amount less than such minimum quantity.  However, when the remaining quantity<br>on the order is less than the MEQ instruction, POSIT will not automatically cancel back the<br>remaining quantity of the order, but will attempt to execute that unfilled portion in a single<br>execution.  Subscribers can also instruct that their orders only execute against a single contra that<br>meets the MEQ instruction for their order, as described in Part III, Item 7(a).  If Subscribers do<br>not request this, POSIT's default behavior is to consolidate contra interest to meet a Subscriber's<br>MEQ Instruction.  Subscribers can request that POSIT always cancel remaining shares after an<br>execution where the remaining quantity on the order is less than the MEQ, as described in Part<br>III, Item 7a.<br>Where multiple resting orders have a MEQ instruction specified by the Subscriber, POSIT can<br>alter the pro-rata formula to allow an execution when one might otherwise not occur:<br>*	In that circumstance pro-rata reallocation ratio is 80/20.  This means that if an order is<br>getting 1000 shares as per initial pro-rata calculation, 80% (800 shares) will be allocated, and<br>20% (200 shares) can be used to satisfy the minimum shares of other, larger orders with a<br>minimum quantity size.  In certain instances, the reallocation will result on one resting order<br>being filled with all of the eligible shares and the other order(s) receiving no allocation.<br>*	There is a threshold above which the 80/20 rule applies. Orders with pro-rata allocations<br>equal to or less than 200 shares are not guaranteed any allocation.<br>If multiple orders do not meet their MEQ instructions in the initial allocation, order size priority<br>is used as a tie-breaker to allocate additional shares to satisfy MEQ instructions.<br>Please see Attachment 11(c) for illustrative examples.<br>	Alert Crossing Session conform<br>VAL offers a conditional messaging system known as Alert.
