The Firm<br>operates POSIT on a matching engine that runs on a standalone server in the NY5 Data Center.<br>See Part I, Item 7; and Part III, Item 6(a).  The POSIT matching engine communicates with<br>shared systems to book trades, to report executed trades to the tape, to facilitate clearance and<br>settlement, for financial reporting and billing, and to facilitate other post-trade processes.  The<br>Firm operates the Alert application on servers that are separate from the POSIT matching engine.<br>These systems contain Confidential Information.  See Part II, Item 6 for information on<br>personnel that have access to Confidential Information.<br>AGGREGATED ANONYMOUS DATA.  Data which has been aggregated and which does not<br>identify any Subscribers is not Confidential Information ("Aggregated Anonymous Data").  The<br>Firm publishes firm-wide aggregated anonymous execution data to market wide trade<br>advertisement systems after the transaction has been reported to the consolidated tape.  The data<br>does not include any client identities but does include symbol level executed volumes.  While the<br>Firm does not consider this data to be Confidential Information, it does not include POSIT<br>Aggregated Anonymous Data in these reports.<br>The Firm posts monthly statistics on its website and disseminates this data to Subscribers ("the<br>Monthly POSIT and Alert Statistics").  The Monthly POSIT and Alert Statistics are available at<br>https://www.virtu.com/about/transparency and provide aggregate and anonymous information<br>about POSIT and Alert, including total volume; volume by sector; volume by market cap; fill<br>size distribution; distribution of Alert block size, and distribution of executions at the bid, mid<br>and offer.  The Firm produces market commentary from time-to-time that discusses general<br>market trends.  The statistical data described in this paragraph can be used to produce market<br>commentary.  The Firm considers this data to be Aggregated Anonymous Data and not<br>Confidential Information.  The Firm does not permit Subscribers to opt out of having their data<br>included in these reports.<br>SALES DATA.  Sales Data is aggregated information about the products and services the Firm's<br>clients use and includes the client's name, the product or service they use, aggregate executed<br>volume, and revenues ("Sales Data").  Sales Data includes aggregated ATS data as described in<br>the preceding sentence.  The Firm provides Sales Data to management personnel, Sales or<br>Trading personnel, Relationship Management personnel and Alert Sales and Coverage personnel<br>who are involved in handling relationships with the Firm's clients.  Sales Data is provided for the<br>purpose of allowing these personnel to keep abreast of the client's business activities to manage<br>the client relationship and to cross sell the Firm's products and services to the client.  The Firm<br>does not consider Sales Data to be Confidential Information when distributed internally for the<br>above described purposes.  The Firm makes this information available in end of day reports and<br>in sales systems (i.e., systems that support activities of Sales or Trading personnel, Relationship<br>Management personnel and Alert Sales and Coverage personnel for the purposes described<br>above) on T+1.  The Firm prohibits personnel from disclosing Sales Data to third parties.  The<br>Firm does not permit Subscribers to opt out of having this data made available to personnel<br>involved handling client relationships, as defined in Part II, Item 6(a).<br>PERSONNEL WITH ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The Firm does not<br>have any personnel whose sole responsibility is for the operations of POSIT.  The shared<br>personnel discussed in response to Part II, Item 6(a), have access to Confidential Information.<br>SAFEGUARDS AND OVERSEEING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The Firm maintains<br>written policies and procedures regarding use and protection of Confidential Information.  Firm<br>personnel are subject to its parent, Virtu Financial Inc.'s Code of Conduct and Employee Manual.<br>Firm personnel are also subject to the Firm's Information Security Policy, Compliance Manual,<br>and Written Supervisory Procedures.<br>These policies prohibit the personnel listed in Part II, Item 6(a), from sharing Confidential<br>Information with other personnel who are not in one of these permitted categories or with any<br>other person.  The exception is that Compliance and Legal personnel may provide information to<br>regulators in response to regulatory requests or to third parties pursuant to subpoena.  Personnel<br>who violate the Firm's policies concerning Confidential Information are subject to discipline,<br>including termination of their employment.  The Firm performs email reviews and employs data<br>loss software as a means of safeguarding Confidential Information.<br>The Firm procedures require that personnel make requests for access to its systems through the<br>Firm's access ticketing system and to receive approval from a supervisor prior to being granted<br>access to any systems.  The Firm's supervisory personnel grant access to systems on the premise<br>that it is necessary to perform their duties and to carry out the purpose for which the information<br>is provided to them.  The supervisor responsible for POSIT and Alert approves requests for<br>access to the POSIT matching engine and Alert application.  The Firm only permits approved<br>personnel in the categories described in Part II, Item 6(a), to have access to Confidential<br>Information and only permits these personnel to access the systems and the Confidential<br>Information contained therein using approved means of access and credentials.  Supervisors do<br>not grant access to Confidential Information. The Firm maintains a process that sends<br>notifications to designated personnel to disable systems access for personnel who are no longer<br>employed by the Firm.  Supervisors are responsible for instructing the technology personnel to<br>disable access when employees change roles.  The Firm provides reports to the supervisors that<br>show personnel with access to the POSIT matching engine and Alert application on a monthly<br>basis.  Supervisors review these reports to ensure that these personnel still require access to carry<br>out responsibilities related to the ATS.<br>PERSONAL TRADING RESTRICTIONS.  The Firm maintains employee trading policies that<br>require personnel to disclose their own personal accounts and the accounts of close family<br>members, that prohibit personnel from trading based on any client Confidential Information, that<br>require personnel to pre-clear transactions and attest at the time of trade entry that they are not<br>trading on Confidential Information, and that prescribe holding periods for securities purchases.<br>The Firm conducts reviews of employee trading to determine whether trades were pre-cleared<br>and whether holding periods were observed.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

For Broker-Dealers the<br>Firm doesn't have a specific net capital requirement, but will consider the nature of the business<br>flow, whether there will be large mark-to-market exposures, anticipated revenues provide<br>sufficient risk vs. reward ratios, whether the Subscriber is part of a larger group and there are<br>explicit or implicit guarantees. For non-Broker-Dealers that do not meet one of the criteria to be<br>defined as an Institutional Investor, exceptions may be granted is there is a degree of confidence<br>the company will grow and meet the definition of institutional investor in the future.  The<br>Product Manager for the ATS approves or denies access to the ATS.

Day orders can also include a Market, Mid-Point, Primary Peg<br>or Limit Price<br>instruction.<br>(3) IOC Orders: IOC orders will either execute if an eligible contra side order exists against<br>which the order can be executed or if not the order is canceled.  Subscribers may enter IOC<br>orders with Market, Mid-Point, Primary Peg or Limit Price instructions.<br><br>Other available Instructions and Designations for the Continuous Crossing Session: The<br>following<br>instructions may be applied to the above order types unless otherwise indicated.

POSIT will cancel back an order to the Direct Subscriber if the residual quantity of an<br>order falls below the MEQ instruction.<br><br>(ii) Locked Market: A Locked Market instruction specifies that an order is not eligible for<br>execution during locked markets. IOC orders entered with a Locked Market instruction<br>will be accepted if the NBBO is locked, but will receive a 'Nothing Done' message. Peg orders will<br>be accepted but ineligible for execution until the NBBO unlocks.<br><br>(iii) Peg Order Add-Only Liquidity Instruction ("Add Only"): An Add-Only instruction<br>specifies that the order is only eligible for execution when it adds liquidity to POSIT upon<br>entry. Peg orders that would remove liquidity from POSIT will be accepted by POSIT<br>and remain open but ineligible for execution until such a time as the order adds liquidity to<br>POSIT. Contra-side Peg orders on the book at the time a Peg order with an Add Only<br>instruction is entered will not interact with the Peg Add Only order.  The Add Only instruction<br>will be ignored if specified for an IOC order.<br><br>(iv) Virtu Principal Opt Out: Direct and Indirect Subscribers may request to have<br>their orders not interact with Virtu principal orders. This instruction will only prevent<br>interaction against orders entered by VAL under the MPID's NITE, VIRT and<br>VALX. Principal orders entered by VAL or the Affiliates, as defined in Part II, Item 2a, using<br>other MPIDs will not be subject to this opt out. See Part II, Item 3a for more detail.  This order<br>instruction can only be specified at the session level, and cannot be specified on an order by<br>order basis via a FIX tag.<br><br>(v) POSIT Liquidity Profiles and Limits on Interaction: This instruction specifies the<br>types of counterparties that an order may interact with based on the counterparty's<br>Liquidity Profile. POSIT uses quantitative metrics to create one or more Liquidity Profiles for<br>each POSIT Subscriber. The metrics include execution performance relative to the market over<br>different time horizons for all fills in POSIT. POSIT makes discretionary decisions in assigning a<br>Liquidity Profile to a new or previously uncategorized Subscriber. POSIT will inform<br>Subscribers about their own profile information upon request.  See Part III, Item 13a for more<br>detail on POSIT Liquidity Profiles.<br>(vi) Self-Match Prevention: Subscribers may provide instructions that will prevent<br>orders from crossing if the resulting cross may result in a transaction with no change<br>in beneficial ownership.  This order instruction can only be specified at the session level, and<br>cannot be specified on an order by order basis via a FIX tag.<br><br> An order that contains a value in a utilized FIX field other than a value recognized by VAL (as<br>described in its FIX specifications) will be rejected.

Human Participants can manually respond to Firm-Up Requests or configure the<br>Alert software to automatically respond.  For Human Participants, Alert will send the Invitation<br>to Firm-Up to the Alert Front End via a pop up window, requesting the Human Participant to<br>Firm-Up.  The pop up window indicates that a contra order exists in a given symbol, as well as<br>indicates if the contra is an Electronic Participant, but does not provide any size or price<br>information of the contra order.  For an execution to occur, the Human Participant must respond<br>to the pop-up window by submitting a Firm-Up Response.  The one exception to this workflow<br>is for Human Participants who have enabled Auto-Ex on their order, which is described in Part<br>III, Item 7a. The Auto-Ex order instruction can only be set by the Human Participant in the Alert<br>software.  The Auto-Ex instruction will remain in effect until one of the following occurs: 1. The<br>Human Participant turns off Auto-Ex on the order, 2. The Human Participant is fully filled on the<br>Auto-Ex order, 3. The trading day ends. The Alert software will the send a Firm-Up Response<br>Order from the Human Participant's EMS to VAL for submission to the POSIT ATS Alert<br>Crossing Session that references the invitation and matches the attributes of the invitation in<br>terms of symbol, side and quantity. Human Participants can change order quantities up or down<br>prior to submitting a Firm-Up Response.  VAL's agency desks and clients of its Affiliates cannot<br>use the Alert Front End to view and interact with conditional interests.  They are Electronic<br>Participants and can only send orders to algorithms that can send Conditional Orders through<br>Alert.<br>Electronic Participants do not install Alert software.  Rather, Electronic Participants transmit<br>Conditional Orders directly to the Alert matching application through the Electronic<br>Participant's algorithm or electronic system.   Alert will send an Invitation to Firm-Up to the<br>algorithm or system that entered a Conditional Order when a potential matching opportunity<br>exists.  When the Invitation to Firm-Up message is sent to an Electronic Participant, the<br>Electronic Participant's original Conditional Order is automatically canceled.  Hereinafter,<br>Electronic Participant and algorithm or system shall have the same meaning.  For an execution<br>to occur, the Electronic Participant must respond to the invitation by transmitting a Firm-Up<br>Response Order.  Alert will transmit an Invitation to Firm-Up to the Electronic Participant<br>containing the same number of shares included in the Electronic Participant's original<br>Conditional Order.  The Electronic Participant may then respond by sending a Firm-Up<br>Response Order to VAL for submission to the POSIT ATS Alert Crossing Session that<br>references the invitation and matches the attributes of the invitation in terms of symbol, side<br>and quantity.  The Electronic Participant may transmit a Firm-Up Response Order with a<br>quantity that is less or more than the invited quantity.  An execution will occur to the extent that<br>Firm-Up Response Orders are received by POSIT within the designated response time, subject<br>to other instructions placed on the orders by the participant, as described in Part III item 7.  All<br>business units and affiliates of the broker dealer operator that enter or direct the entry of orders<br>into POSIT ALERT are considered Electronic Participants, and are not treated any differently<br>than Electronic Participants external to the broker dealer operator.<br>When multiple Conditional Orders are present on the same side and same symbol, the Alert<br>matching application will give invitation priority in the following order: Human Participant<br>with Auto-Ex enabled, Human Participant without Auto-Ex enabled, Electronic Participant.<br>When two participants are on the same side and fall within the same participant type (i.e., two<br>Human Participants with Auto-Ex enabled, two Human Participants without Auto-Ex enabled,<br>or two Electronic Participants), the Alert matching application will use order size as the second<br>order of invitation priority.  For example, if two Human Participants are present on the same<br>side and same symbol, and a single contra order is submitted, the Human Participant with the<br>largest order size will receive an invitation message.  Lastly, if two participants are on the same<br>side, fall within the same participant type, and have the same order size, order submission time<br>will be used as the third order of priority to determine which participant would receive the<br>invitation.<br>The response time to the Invitation to Firm-Up is a function of the type of participants invited.<br>Electronic Participants must respond within 2 seconds, while Human Participants without Auto-<br>Ex enabled have 30 seconds to respond.  Participants who do not respond within these time<br>frames will not be eligible to participate in the match.<br>Alert invites all participants in the potential match simultaneously, except as described below.<br>When an Electronic Participant has a potential match against a Human Participant, the Human<br>Participant will receive the Invitation to Firm-Up first.  Once the Human Participant firms up,<br>an Invitation to Firm-Up is then sent to the Electronic Participant.  If the Human Participant<br>does not firm up, the Electronic Participant will not receive an Invitation to Firm-Up.<br>In addition to the messaging described above to Alert participants, Alert will transmit<br>information to POSIT on the potential Alert match.  At the time Invitations to Firm-Up are sent<br>to participants, Alert sends the following information to POSIT on the potential Alert match: 1)<br>Number of buyers, 2) Number of sellers, 3) Number of Human Participants, 4) Symbol, 5)<br>Response timer.  POSIT will run the match at the earlier of when all participants submit firm up<br>orders to POSIT or the expiration of the response timer.<br>After the completion of the match, or the expiration of the response timer, POSIT will transmit<br>information on the outcome of the match back to Alert.  This information is stored to log files<br>that are consumed by a front end application called Phoenix.  Phoenix is used by Alert Sales and<br>Coverage personnel to monitor client orders in Alert, as described in Part II, Item 6a.<br>Upon request, POSIT will apply a maximum notional value constraint, set by the Alert<br>participant, to an Alert participant's order. In addition, upon request and only available to Human<br>participants, POSIT will aggregate an Alert participant's orders for execution. Where such Alert<br>orders have a common MEQ instruction, POSIT will apply the MEQ instruction on the<br>aggregated Alert order.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

Direct Subscribers may enter instructions that when present on orders will prevent<br>interaction with orders from Subscribers who fall into specified Liquidity Profiles.

To the extent that<br>VAL, its Affiliates or Direct Subscriber's transmit the orders of multiple Indirect Subscribers<br>through a single POSIT Moniker, the Liquidity Profile will be the composite of all of the Indirect<br>Subscribers. An exception is that VAL permits Direct Subscribers to have different order flows<br>scored independently based upon a Segment ID FIX tag. The Current POSIT FIX Specification<br>Document provides Direct Subscribers the ability to use up to four Segment IDs labeled Segment<br>1, Segment 2, Segment 3 and Segment 4.<br>VAL uses a scoring methodology to determine a Subscriber's Liquidity Profiles that is derived<br>from the price move of a stock from the midpoint price at the time of fill to a weighted average<br>of individual midpoint prices of durations that range from 10 minutes to 60 minutes after the time of<br>fill, divided by the stock's spread (a "mark out").

After sorting Subscribers markout scores from<br>most negative to most positive, the Liquidity Profiles are constructed such that approximately<br>20% of the share volume of the most negative markout Subscribers are placed into the Move<br>Towards category, 60% of the share volume is placed in the Neutral category, 20% of the share<br>volume of the most positive markout Subscribers are placed in the Move Away category. The<br>percentages are approximations. Based on the mix of Subscribers' share volume, they may not<br>perfectly fit into a Segment such that the percentages are exact.

VAL uses its own discretion to place new Subscribers into one of the three Segments described above. Segment<br>selection for new Subscribers is based on VAL's subjective judgment of the trading and<br>investment process employed by the new Subscriber. For new Subscribers that have no prior history trading in POSIT, Segment selection is based on the type of firm, as well as the expected characteristics of the order flow, as specified by the new Subscriber.  For new Subscribers that have a history trading in POSIT (for example, a current Subscriber that wants to set up a new POSIT moniker), Segment selection is based on the type of firm, the expected characteristics of the order flow (as specified by the new Subscriber), as well as the Segment placement of other POSIT Monikers associated with the same underlying Subscriber.
