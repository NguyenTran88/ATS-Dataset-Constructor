        <taPart2Item1aUnitNamesEnterInterest>Virtu Americas LLC ("VAL" or the "Firm") operates two POSIT ATS ("POSIT" or the "ATS") crossing sessions, a Continuous Crossing Session and the Alert Crossing Session, as well as other business units which are described below.  The Firm's business
units each use one or more technology platforms that have MPIDs associated with the platform.  A
single business unit can enter or direct orders to the ATS through more than one technology
platform and consequently under more than one MPID.  These business units are described below.
Virtu Electronic Trading ("VET").  VET provides algorithms that are used by clients and the
Firm's business units.  VET algorithms enter or direct the entry of orders to POSIT as agent when
those orders are entered by clients into the algorithms or as principal or riskless principal when
one of the other business units enters orders into the algorithms using the MPIDs:
VALR and VALX.

Virtu Client Market Making ("VCMM").  VCMM handles held and not held orders transmitted by
other broker-dealers and held orders transmitted by institutions.  The majority of these orders are
SEC Rule 605 eligible orders and are handled and executed on a fully automated basis.  VCMM
sales and trading personnel handle larger and less liquid orders manually and can use VET
algorithms in connection with their market making activities.  VCMM enters or directs the entry of
orders to POSIT as principal, riskless principal and agent to acquire inventory to fill orders or to
acquire positions for its own account using the following MPIDs: NITE, VALR and
VALX.
Virtu Institutional Trading ("Institutional Trading").  Institutional Trading handles not held orders
transmitted by institutional clients and facilitates block transactions in single stocks.  Institutional
Trading uses VET algorithms to enter or direct the entry of orders as principal or riskless
principal in connection with its client facilitation activities using the following MPIDs: NITE and VALX.
Virtu Hi-Touch Portfolio Trading: Traders on this desk handle not held orders in baskets of
stocks and ETFs. Traders can enter or direct the entry of orders through VAL Electronic Systems
into the ATS as agent under the MPID ITGI.

Virtu ETF Trading ("ETF Trading").  ETF Trading makes markets on exchanges and facilitates
block transactions in exchange traded products for broker-dealer and institutional clients.  ETF
Trading uses VET algorithms to enter or direct the entry of orders as principal or riskless
principal in ETFs and singles stocks using the MPID VALX.
Virtu Principal Market Making ("VPMM"). VPMM is a market maker in NMS equity securities.
VPMM enters or directs the entry of orders as principal to POSIT utilizing the MPID VIRT.</taPart2Item1aUnitNamesEnterInterest>

POSIT under the MPIDs NITE, VIRT and VALX ("the Principal Opt-Out").  Orders entered into
POSIT by VAL under the MPID VALR are not subject to the Principal Opt-Out.
Subscribers can request the Principal Opt-Out through their sales persons.  Following receipt of a
request, the sales person will enter a ticket to make the request.  Thereafter, an entry is made in a
configuration file which will take effect in most cases on the next business day, but could take
effect either the same day or greater than the next business day, depending upon the time of day
the request is submitted.  When the POSIT matching logic is applied, the configuration file is
checked to determine whether orders are eligible for crossing with VAL or its Affiliate's  (see
Part II, item 2a) principal orders entered under the above referenced MPIDs.  VAL does not
allow POSIT Subscribers to opt out of interacting with any orders submitted to POSIT by VAL
or its Affiliates when they are submitted under any of the other MPIDs referenced in Part II, Item

        <taPart2Item6aUnitAfflEmployeeServices>VAL does not have any personnel whose sole responsibility is for POSIT.  The Firm considers
information relating to Subscriber's live orders, trading interests and recent executions in POSIT
that the Firm reasonably believes may suggest a Subscriber continues at that moment in time to
have the same or additional live orders and trading interests in POSIT, to be ATS confidential
information ("Confidential Information").  As is more fully discussed in Part III, Item 7(a), VAL
does not consider all post trade data to be Confidential Information, particularly when the
information is anonymized, aggregated or both.
Below is a summary of the shared personnel that provide services to both POSIT, VAL, and its
Affiliates and have access to Confidential Information.
*	Compliance and Legal:  Compliance and Legal personnel support all of the Firm's
business units and those of the Firm's Affiliates and perform a variety of compliance and
legal activities related to their roles.  They have access to Subscriber historical order and
execution information and as necessary they can be provided with access to intra-day
information.
*	Finance and Management Reporting Group:  Finance and management reporting
personnel support all of the Firm's business units and those of the Firm's Affiliates.
These personnel are involved in accounting, billing, analyzing revenues, and providing
management reporting information.  They have access to Subscribers' historical post-
trade execution information and data.
*	Operations:  Operations personnel support the Firm's middle and back office processes
for clearance and settlement and related activities and have access to Subscribers' real
time intra-day, post-trade, and historical execution information for clearing, settlement,
and regulatory reporting purposes.
*	Core Operations:  Core Operations are technical personnel who have access to the Firm's
and its Affiliates' trading infrastructure, which includes POSIT, to monitor the
functionality, health, and wellness of the Firm's trading infrastructure and take action as
necessary to maintain the systems and manage issues.  They have access to Subscribers'
real-time and historical order and execution information.  This group supports all trading
infrastructure and applications for the Firm.
*	Software Developers:  Software Developers have access to the Firm's and its Affiliates'
trading infrastructure, which includes POSIT, to maintain and enhance the software for
the Firm's trading applications.  They have access to Subscribers' real-time and historical
order and execution information.  This group supports all trading infrastructure and
applications for the Firm.
*	Product Management: Product Management are personnel who manage the day-to-day
business activities for products such as POSIT, the algorithms the Firm provides to
clients, and other trading-related applications VAL and its Affiliates provide to clients.
These personnel monitor the trading applications, enhance their product features, and
create new features.  Product Management compile and analyze statistics and metrics
related to the ATS and other electronic products and services.  Product Management
works with Software Developers, and in some instances are also Software Developers
themselves.  The Product Manager responsible for supervising POSIT is also the Product
Manager responsible for supervising VAL's other ATS, MatchIt, and also provides
support to both VAL's Affiliates' execution services applications. Product Management
have access to Subscribers' real-time and historical order and execution information.
*	Relationship Management:  Relationship Management personnel are responsible for
managing the Firm's relationship with its clients, including clients who are Direct
Subscribers of the ATS, and for cross-selling the Firm's other products and services.
They have access to historical order and execution information.
*	Sales and/or Trading personnel:  To the extent Sales or Trading personnel are responsible
for handling an order, a portion of which is directed to POSIT as a child order, such
personnel would have real time access to such child order and any of its executions in
POSIT analogous to the access they would have to information about orders and
executions that were directed to external market centers in order to monitor executions
and provide order-related services.
*	POSIT Alert ("Alert") Sales and Coverage: The Firm offers an application called Alert
that is a conditional order application which resides outside of the POSIT Matching
engine and which transmit orders to the Alert Crossing Session to consummate trades.
See Part III, Item 9 and 11 for further descriptions of Alert and the Alert Crossing
Session.  Alert Sales and Coverage personnel are responsible for the sales and day-to-day
coverage of Alert.  Alert Sales and Coverage personnel have access to a front end
application called Phoenix, which displays real-time order and execution information of
Alert participants.  See, Part III, Item 9 for further discussion about Alert.  This group can
access Alert participants' real-time and historical order and execution information, but do
not have access to any real-time or historical order and execution information in POSIT's
matching engines for the Continuous Crossing Session.
*	Analytics Personnel: Analytics Personnel provide transaction cost analysis data and
consultancy to institutional investors.  This group is separate from the business units of
the broker dealer operator that enter or direct the entry of orders and trading interest into
POSIT, as defined in Part II, Item 1(a). The Firm offers a product called the Analytics
Portal ("the Portal") that provides pre-trade, real-time and post-trade analytics to the
Firm's clients.  In order to enable and support client trade reporting in the Portal,
Analytics personnel have access to real-time order and execution information for Alert
participants. This group can access Alert participants' real-time and historical order and
execution information, but do not have access to any real-time or historical order and
execution information in POSIT's matching engines for the Continuous Crossing Session.

      </part2Item6bDoesAnyEntitySupportServices>
      <taPart2Item7aDescrOfSafeGaurdsAndProcedures>GENERAL BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Firm
operates POSIT on a matching engine that runs on a standalone server in the NY5 Data Center.
See Part I, Item 7; and Part III, Item 6(a).  The POSIT matching engine communicates with
shared systems to book trades, to report executed trades to the tape, to facilitate clearance and
settlement, for financial reporting and billing, and to facilitate other post-trade processes.  The
Firm operates the Alert application on servers that are separate from the POSIT matching engine.
These systems contain Confidential Information.  See Part II, Item 6 for information on
personnel that have access to Confidential Information.
AGGREGATED ANONYMOUS DATA.  Data which has been aggregated and which does not
identify any Subscribers is not Confidential Information ("Aggregated Anonymous Data").  The
Firm publishes firm-wide aggregated anonymous execution data to market wide trade
advertisement systems after the transaction has been reported to the consolidated tape.  The data
does not include any client identities but does include symbol level executed volumes.  While the
Firm does not consider this data to be Confidential Information, it does not include POSIT
Aggregated Anonymous Data in these reports.
The Firm posts monthly statistics on its website and disseminates this data to Subscribers ("the
Monthly POSIT and Alert Statistics").  The Monthly POSIT and Alert Statistics are available at
https://www.virtu.com/about/transparency and provide aggregate and anonymous information
about POSIT and Alert, including total volume; volume by sector; volume by market cap; fill
size distribution; distribution of Alert block size, and distribution of executions at the bid, mid
and offer.  The Firm produces market commentary from time-to-time that discusses general
market trends.  The statistical data described in this paragraph can be used to produce market
commentary.  The Firm considers this data to be Aggregated Anonymous Data and not
Confidential Information.  The Firm does not permit Subscribers to opt out of having their data
included in these reports.
SALES DATA.  Sales Data is aggregated information about the products and services the Firm's
clients use and includes the client's name, the product or service they use, aggregate executed
volume, and revenues ("Sales Data").  Sales Data includes aggregated ATS data as described in
the preceding sentence.  The Firm provides Sales Data to management personnel, Sales or
Trading personnel, Relationship Management personnel and Alert Sales and Coverage personnel
who are involved in handling relationships with the Firm's clients.  Sales Data is provided for the
purpose of allowing these personnel to keep abreast of the client's business activities to manage
the client relationship and to cross sell the Firm's products and services to the client.  The Firm
does not consider Sales Data to be Confidential Information when distributed internally for the
above described purposes.  The Firm makes this information available in end of day reports and
in sales systems (i.e., systems that support activities of Sales or Trading personnel, Relationship
Management personnel and Alert Sales and Coverage personnel for the purposes described
above) on T+1.  The Firm prohibits personnel from disclosing Sales Data to third parties.  The
Firm does not permit Subscribers to opt out of having this data made available to personnel
involved handling client relationships, as defined in Part II, Item 6(a).
PERSONNEL WITH ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The Firm does not
have any personnel whose sole responsibility is for the operations of POSIT.  The shared
personnel discussed in response to Part II, Item 6(a), have access to Confidential Information.
SAFEGUARDS AND OVERSEEING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The Firm maintains
written policies and procedures regarding use and protection of Confidential Information.  Firm
personnel are subject to its parent, Virtu Financial Inc.'s Code of Conduct and Employee Manual.
Firm personnel are also subject to the Firm's Information Security Policy, Compliance Manual,
and Written Supervisory Procedures.
These policies prohibit the personnel listed in Part II, Item 6(a), from sharing Confidential
Information with other personnel who are not in one of these permitted categories or with any
other person.  The exception is that Compliance and Legal personnel may provide information to
regulators in response to regulatory requests or to third parties pursuant to subpoena.  Personnel
who violate the Firm's policies concerning Confidential Information are subject to discipline,
including termination of their employment.  The Firm performs email reviews and employs data
loss software as a means of safeguarding Confidential Information.
The Firm procedures require that personnel make requests for access to its systems through the
Firm's access ticketing system and to receive approval from a supervisor prior to being granted
access to any systems.  The Firm's supervisory personnel grant access to systems on the premise
that it is necessary to perform their duties and to carry out the purpose for which the information
is provided to them.  The supervisor responsible for POSIT and Alert approves requests for
access to the POSIT matching engine and Alert application.  The Firm only permits approved
personnel in the categories described in Part II, Item 6(a), to have access to Confidential
Information and only permits these personnel to access the systems and the Confidential
Information contained therein using approved means of access and credentials.  Supervisors do
not grant access to Confidential Information. The Firm maintains a process that sends
notifications to designated personnel to disable systems access for personnel who are no longer
employed by the Firm.  Supervisors are responsible for instructing the technology personnel to
disable access when employees change roles.  The Firm provides reports to the supervisors that
show personnel with access to the POSIT matching engine and Alert application on a monthly
basis.  Supervisors review these reports to ensure that these personnel still require access to carry
out responsibilities related to the ATS.
PERSONAL TRADING RESTRICTIONS.  The Firm maintains employee trading policies that
require personnel to disclose their own personal accounts and the accounts of close family
members, that prohibit personnel from trading based on any client Confidential Information, that
require personnel to pre-clear transactions and attest at the time of trade entry that they are not
trading on Confidential Information, and that prescribe holding periods for securities purchases.
The Firm conducts reviews of employee trading to determine whether trades were pre-cleared
and whether holding periods were observed.</taPart2Item7aDescrOfSafeGaurdsAndProcedures>
      <part2Item7bCanSubscriberConsentToDisclosure rbPart2Item7bCanSubscriberConsentToDisclosure="Y">
        <taPart2Item7bExplainHowAndConditions>By virtue of their use of POSIT, VAL considers all Subscribers to have consented to the
disclosure of Confidential Information as described in Part II, Item 6(a) and consented to the
disclosure of Aggregated Anonymous Data to the public and Sales Data to management
personnel, Sales or Trading personnel, Relationship Management personnel and Alert Sales and
Coverage personnel internally as described in Part II, Item 7(a) above.
Subscribers may consent to disclosure of their own Confidential Information to any person they
choose by submitting a written request to their Sales or Trading person, Relationship
Management person or Alert Sales and Coverage person describing the nature of the information
the wish to disclose and the scope of the disclosure they wish to make.  For example, a
Subscriber may wish to request that their data be disclosed to a Sales or Trading person to
monitor their activity or for analysis.</taPart2Item7bExplainHowAndConditions>
        <part2Item7cCanSubscriberWithdrawConsent rbPart2Item7cCanSubscriberWithdrawConsent="Y">
          <taPart2Item7cExplainHowAndConditions>To the extent a Subscriber has made a request to disclose Confidential Information that is ongoing,
See Part II, Item 7(b), or wishes to opt out of the disclosure of Aggregated Anonymous Data that
is reported market-wide dissemination systems, See Part II, Item 7(a), the subscriber may submit
a written request to their sales person.   The sales person will create a ticket for operation staff to
carry out the request.  In most cases, the request will be honored on the next business day, but
could take effect either the same day or greater than the next business day, depending upon the
time of day the request is submitted.  Sales and Operations will verify that the request has been
implemented.
Otherwise, VAL does not permit Subscribers to opt out of having their Aggregated Anonymous
Data included in the Monthly POSIT and Alert Statistics, in market commentary that uses this
data, or from having Sales Data provided to management personnel, Sales or Trading personnel,
Relationship Management personnel and Alert Sales and Coverage personnel, for the purposes
noted in Part II, Item 6(a).</taPart2Item7cExplainHowAndConditions>

      <taPart2Item7dSummaryOfRolesRespOfPersons>The shared personnel described in response to Part II, Item 6(a) have access to Confidential
Information, as described in Part II, Item 6(a). These personnel have access to that information
for the purpose of carrying out their job functions.
To the extent Sales and Trading Personnel direct orders to the ATS, those orders and related
executions are available to Sales and Trading Personnel who may analyze the data for the
purposes of understanding the performance of the algorithms.
As described in Part II, Item 7(a), the Firm makes public Aggregated Anonymous Data to further
the Firm's efforts to market its products and services.  The Firm does not consider Aggregated
Anonymous Data to be Confidential Information.  The Firm provides Sales Data to management
personnel, Sales or Trading personnel, Relationship Management personnel and Alert Sales and
Coverage personnel so that they may keep abreast of their clients' activities and coordinate the
Firm's sales efforts.  The Firm does not make this information available to third parties.  The
Firm does not consider Sales Data to be Confidential Information when it is provided to
management personnel, Sales or Trading personnel, Relationship Management personnel and Alert
Sales and Coverage personnel or these purposes.</taPart2Item7dSummaryOfRolesRespOfPersons>

        <taPart3Item2bSummaryOfCndtns>The Firm permits applicants who satisfy certain eligibility requirements to become Direct
Subscribers.  Direct Subscribers must be institutional investors or broker dealers.  Additionally,
Direct Subscribers must execute an electronic access agreement, and submit the standard on-
boarding documentation that all clients of the Firm must submit.  Such documentation includes
"know your customer" information, financial information to assess counterparty risk and
establish a trading limit, and relevant agreements such as Agreements to Give Up ("AGU") or
Qualified Service Representative Agreements ("QSR") to facilitate trade clearance.  The Firm
performs reviews to assess a client's prior disciplinary history.  A disciplinary history related to
market abuse, for example, would potentially preclude a prospective client from being on-
boarded to VAL and consequently would preclude the client from being permitted access to the
ATS.
The Firm evaluates factors such as an institutional investor's assets and assets under
management, a broker-dealer's net capital and its clearing firm's net capital to the extent a
broker-dealer is not self-clearing, and credit ratings in making on-boarding determinations.
Institutions must meet the FINRA definition of Institutional Investor.  For Broker-Dealers the
Firm doesn't have a specific net capital requirement, but will consider the nature of the business
flow, whether there will be large mark-to-market exposures, anticipated revenues provide
sufficient risk vs. reward ratios, whether the Subscriber is part of a larger group and there are
explicit or implicit guarantees. For non-Broker-Dealers that do not meet one of the criteria to be
defined as an Institutional Investor, exceptions may be granted is there is a degree of confidence
the company will grow and meet the definition of institutional investor in the future.  The
Product Manager for the ATS approves or denies access to the ATS.  Clients who are not
approved for access to the ATS would generally also not be approved for any other VAL
services.
The Firm requires Indirect Subscribers to go through the same on-boarding process.  The Firm
only on-boards clients who use its EMS, algorithms, and Alert that are broker-dealers or
institutional type clients and does not accept natural persons as clients.</taPart3Item2bSummaryOfCndtns>

existing Subscriber from being excluded from access to the ATS and from other services
provided by VAL.  For example, a disciplinary history related to market abuse or a change in
financial condition such that the Subscriber fails to satisfy VAL's counter-party risk criteria
could preclude a Subscriber from continued access to the ATS.  Additionally, a subscriber can be

      <taPart3Item7AOrdrTypExplain>Continuous Crossing Session

POSIT accepts Peg orders, Day orders and Immediate or Cancel ("IOC") orders.  Peg and Day
orders may execute against contra-side Peg orders, contra-side Day orders or against IOC orders.
IOC orders may only cross against contra-side Peg orders or contra-side Day orders. These order
types may be entered with other instructions that will be used by the matching algorithm to
determine whether and how they will interact with other orders.
Priority in the POSIT Continuous Crossing Session for all order types is price, then size, then
time.  For orders without a peg instruction, the limit price submitted is used to determine
the price portion of the queue priority.  For orders with a peg instruction, the less aggressive
price between the current peg price and limit price submitted is used to determine the price
portion of the queue priority.  If the algorithm modifies the terms of a previously transmitted
order, the order will receive a new order time stamp for matching purposes (i.e. the order will
lose queue spot).  The only exception is a reduction in order quantity which, absent any other
changes to the terms of the order, will not update the order time stamp for matching purposes.
The following instructions are available for orders entered in the POSIT Continuous Crossing
Session.  The instructions placed on orders will affect whether an order is eligible to be executed
against contra-side orders.
(1) Peg Orders: Peg orders remain open until executed, canceled by the Subscriber or until the
end of the daily matching session. Peg orders can be designated with the following execution
instruction:
      (i) Market: A Market instruction designates that a buy order can be executed up to the
national best offer and a sell order can be executed down to the national best bid.
      (ii) Mid-Point: A Mid-Point instruction designates that an order can be executed up to the
mid-point between the national best bid and national best offer ("NBBO").
      (iii) Primary: A Primary instruction designates that the order can only be executed at the
national best bid in the case of a buy order and the national best offer in the case of a sell order.
A Limit Price instruction can be specified for Peg orders in conjunction with the above
referenced execution instruction.
(2) Day Orders: Day orders remain open until executed, canceled by the Subscriber or until the
end of the daily matching session. Day orders can also include a Market, Mid-Point, Primary Peg
or Limit Price
instruction.
(3) IOC Orders: IOC orders will either execute if an eligible contra side order exists against
which the order can be executed or if not the order is canceled.  Subscribers may enter IOC
orders with Market, Mid-Point, Primary Peg or Limit Price instructions.

Other available Instructions and Designations for the Continuous Crossing Session: The
following
instructions may be applied to the above order types unless otherwise indicated. These
instructions may be implemented by either transmitting a specified value over a FIX tag on an
order by order basis, or requesting a session level configuration that will apply the requested
instruction across all orders sent to the session specified by the Direct Subscriber, unless
otherwise indicated:

(i) Minimum Execution Quantity (MEQ): An MEQ instruction specifies the minimum
number of shares that must be available for a contra side order to be eligible for execution.
POSIT does not aggregate multiple contra side orders to satisfy a MEQ instruction on a single
order.  POSIT will cancel back an order to the Direct Subscriber if the residual quantity of an
order falls below the MEQ instruction.

(ii) Locked Market: A Locked Market instruction specifies that an order is not eligible for
execution during locked markets. IOC orders entered with a Locked Market instruction
will be accepted if the NBBO is locked, but will receive a 'Nothing Done' message. Peg orders will
be accepted but ineligible for execution until the NBBO unlocks.

(iii) Peg Order Add-Only Liquidity Instruction ("Add Only"): An Add-Only instruction
specifies that the order is only eligible for execution when it adds liquidity to POSIT upon
entry. Peg orders that would remove liquidity from POSIT will be accepted by POSIT
and remain open but ineligible for execution until such a time as the order adds liquidity to
POSIT. Contra-side Peg orders on the book at the time a Peg order with an Add Only
instruction is entered will not interact with the Peg Add Only order.  The Add Only instruction
will be ignored if specified for an IOC order.

(iv) Virtu Principal Opt Out: Direct and Indirect Subscribers may request to have
their orders not interact with Virtu principal orders. This instruction will only prevent
interaction against orders entered by VAL under the MPID's NITE, VIRT and
VALX. Principal orders entered by VAL or the Affiliates, as defined in Part II, Item 2a, using
other MPIDs will not be subject to this opt out. See Part II, Item 3a for more detail.  This order
instruction can only be specified at the session level, and cannot be specified on an order by
order basis via a FIX tag.

(v) POSIT Liquidity Profiles and Limits on Interaction: This instruction specifies the
types of counterparties that an order may interact with based on the counterparty's
Liquidity Profile. POSIT uses quantitative metrics to create one or more Liquidity Profiles for
each POSIT Subscriber. The metrics include execution performance relative to the market over
different time horizons for all fills in POSIT. POSIT makes discretionary decisions in assigning a
Liquidity Profile to a new or previously uncategorized Subscriber. POSIT will inform
Subscribers about their own profile information upon request.  See Part III, Item 13a for more
detail on POSIT Liquidity Profiles.
(vi) Self-Match Prevention: Subscribers may provide instructions that will prevent
orders from crossing if the resulting cross may result in a transaction with no change
in beneficial ownership.  This order instruction can only be specified at the session level, and
cannot be specified on an order by order basis via a FIX tag.

 An order that contains a value in a utilized FIX field other than a value recognized by VAL (as
described in its FIX specifications) will be rejected.  An order containing a value in a non-
utilized FIX field will be accepted, but that instruction will not be processed.

Alert Crossing Session
The Alert Crossing Session supports all of the order types and instructions described in the
Continuous Crossing Session section in Part III, Item 7(a), with the exception that the Alert
Crossing Session does not accept IOC orders. Additionally, the below order type instructions are
only available in the Alert Crossing Session.
(i) 	Conditional Indicator: Peg orders entered into the Alert Crossing Session are by
default designated as Conditional Orders. Conditional Orders are not firm and
must respond affirmatively to an Invitation to Firm-Up from the Alert Crossing
Session by transmitting a Firm-Up Response Order to be eligible to be executed
against contra-side orders.
(ii) 	Firm-Up Response Order: These orders are entered in response to invitations
from the Alert Crossing Session.
(iii)	Auto-Ex: Human Participants, as described in Part III, Item 9(a), can designate a
Conditional Order as Auto-Ex.  If the Auto-Ex instruction is enabled for a
Conditional Order, the Human Participant will not receive a pop up window
requesting to Firm-Up, as described in Part III, Item 9(a), but instead the
Conditional Order from the Human Participant will automatically Firm-Up
against a contra side order.

        <taPart3Item9aMsgUsgDtls>VAL offers a conditional messaging system known as Alert.  Alert is an anonymous
Conditional Order matching application that exists outside of the POSIT matching engine.
Alert has two types of participants: Human Participants and Electronic Participants.  Alert has
three message types: A Conditional Order; an Invitation to Firm-Up; and a Firm-Up Response
Order.
Human Participants install Alert software, which can be installed on a variety of OMS or EMS
systems, on their systems.  The Alert software takes in information about Human Participants
orders resident in the OMS or EMS and transmits that information to the Alert matching
application in the form of a Conditional Order.  Alert Human Participants configure the
frequency at which the Alert software takes in information about orders resident in their OMS or
EMS.  The Alert software also provides Alert participants with a graphical user interface ("the
Alert Front End") that allows users to see pending Conditional Orders and respond to Invitations
to Firm-Up. Human Participants can manually respond to Firm-Up Requests or configure the
Alert software to automatically respond.  For Human Participants, Alert will send the Invitation
to Firm-Up to the Alert Front End via a pop up window, requesting the Human Participant to
Firm-Up.  The pop up window indicates that a contra order exists in a given symbol, as well as
indicates if the contra is an Electronic Participant, but does not provide any size or price
information of the contra order.  For an execution to occur, the Human Participant must respond
to the pop-up window by submitting a Firm-Up Response.  The one exception to this workflow
is for Human Participants who have enabled Auto-Ex on their order, which is described in Part
III, Item 7a. The Auto-Ex order instruction can only be set by the Human Participant in the Alert
software.  The Auto-Ex instruction will remain in effect until one of the following occurs: 1. The
Human Participant turns off Auto-Ex on the order, 2. The Human Participant is fully filled on the
Auto-Ex order, 3. The trading day ends. The Alert software will the send a Firm-Up Response
Order from the Human Participant's EMS to VAL for submission to the POSIT ATS Alert
Crossing Session that references the invitation and matches the attributes of the invitation in
terms of symbol, side and quantity. Human Participants can change order quantities up or down
prior to submitting a Firm-Up Response.  VAL's agency desks and clients of its Affiliates cannot
use the Alert Front End to view and interact with conditional interests.  They are Electronic
Participants and can only send orders to algorithms that can send Conditional Orders through
Alert.
Electronic Participants do not install Alert software.  Rather, Electronic Participants transmit
Conditional Orders directly to the Alert matching application through the Electronic
Participant's algorithm or electronic system.   Alert will send an Invitation to Firm-Up to the
algorithm or system that entered a Conditional Order when a potential matching opportunity
exists.  When the Invitation to Firm-Up message is sent to an Electronic Participant, the
Electronic Participant's original Conditional Order is automatically canceled.  Hereinafter,
Electronic Participant and algorithm or system shall have the same meaning.  For an execution
to occur, the Electronic Participant must respond to the invitation by transmitting a Firm-Up
Response Order.  Alert will transmit an Invitation to Firm-Up to the Electronic Participant
containing the same number of shares included in the Electronic Participant's original
Conditional Order.  The Electronic Participant may then respond by sending a Firm-Up
Response Order to VAL for submission to the POSIT ATS Alert Crossing Session that
references the invitation and matches the attributes of the invitation in terms of symbol, side
and quantity.  The Electronic Participant may transmit a Firm-Up Response Order with a
quantity that is less or more than the invited quantity.  An execution will occur to the extent that
Firm-Up Response Orders are received by POSIT within the designated response time, subject
to other instructions placed on the orders by the participant, as described in Part III item 7.  All
business units and affiliates of the broker dealer operator that enter or direct the entry of orders
into POSIT ALERT are considered Electronic Participants, and are not treated any differently
than Electronic Participants external to the broker dealer operator.
When multiple Conditional Orders are present on the same side and same symbol, the Alert
matching application will give invitation priority in the following order: Human Participant
with Auto-Ex enabled, Human Participant without Auto-Ex enabled, Electronic Participant.
When two participants are on the same side and fall within the same participant type (i.e., two
Human Participants with Auto-Ex enabled, two Human Participants without Auto-Ex enabled,
or two Electronic Participants), the Alert matching application will use order size as the second
order of invitation priority.  For example, if two Human Participants are present on the same
side and same symbol, and a single contra order is submitted, the Human Participant with the
largest order size will receive an invitation message.  Lastly, if two participants are on the same
side, fall within the same participant type, and have the same order size, order submission time
will be used as the third order of priority to determine which participant would receive the
invitation.
The response time to the Invitation to Firm-Up is a function of the type of participants invited.
Electronic Participants must respond within 2 seconds, while Human Participants without Auto-
Ex enabled have 30 seconds to respond.  Participants who do not respond within these time
frames will not be eligible to participate in the match.
Alert invites all participants in the potential match simultaneously, except as described below.
When an Electronic Participant has a potential match against a Human Participant, the Human
Participant will receive the Invitation to Firm-Up first.  Once the Human Participant firms up,
an Invitation to Firm-Up is then sent to the Electronic Participant.  If the Human Participant
does not firm up, the Electronic Participant will not receive an Invitation to Firm-Up.
In addition to the messaging described above to Alert participants, Alert will transmit
information to POSIT on the potential Alert match.  At the time Invitations to Firm-Up are sent
to participants, Alert sends the following information to POSIT on the potential Alert match: 1)
Number of buyers, 2) Number of sellers, 3) Number of Human Participants, 4) Symbol, 5)
Response timer.  POSIT will run the match at the earlier of when all participants submit firm up
orders to POSIT or the expiration of the response timer.
After the completion of the match, or the expiration of the response timer, POSIT will transmit
information on the outcome of the match back to Alert.  This information is stored to log files
that are consumed by a front end application called Phoenix.  Phoenix is used by Alert Sales and
Coverage personnel to monitor client orders in Alert, as described in Part II, Item 6a.
Upon request, POSIT will apply a maximum notional value constraint, set by the Alert
participant, to an Alert participant's order. In addition, upon request and only available to Human
participants, POSIT will aggregate an Alert participant's orders for execution. Where such Alert
orders have a common MEQ instruction, POSIT will apply the MEQ instruction on the
aggregated Alert order.</taPart3Item9aMsgUsgDtls>

types of orders POSIT will accept prior to the start of regular trading hours or during a trading
halt; however, IOC orders will be cancelled back and Peg orders will remain on the POSIT order
book until trading begins. Unexecuted orders will be cancelled at the market's closing time.
POSIT does not have an opening auction or any specific procedures to reopen after a halt of
trading.  Peg orders will remain on the book during a trading halt, and be prioritized by price, pro

stocks for orders received by POSIT through a variety of means, both direct and indirect, as
described in response to Part III, Item 5.  POSIT operates two general crossing sessions: (i) the
Continuous Crossing Session; (ii) the Alert Crossing Session. Each of these crossing sessions is
described in detail in response to Part III, Item 11(c).  The Continuing Crossing Session employs
a price, size, time priority crossing methodology, as described in Part III, Item 7(a).  All NMS
stocks are eligible for trading in POSIT.  POSIT may, in its sole discretion, stop trading certain
symbols for, among other reasons, the purpose of remaining below the volume thresholds for (i)
classification as an "SCI Entity" under Regulation SCI and (ii) certain regulatory requirements as
set forth in Rules 301(b)(3) and (5) of Regulation ATS.</taPart3Item11aStrucOfNmsStk>

      <taPart3Item11cRulsProcsOfNmsStk>POSIT operates two crossing sessions: (i) the Continuous Crossing Session and (ii) the Alert
Crossing Session.  POSIT offers the ability to participate in the two crossing sessions to all
Subscribers. Note, the rules and procedures applicable to the Continuous Crossing Session apply
to the Alert Crossing session unless otherwise stated.  Subscribers can specify which session to
route an order to via a specific FIX tag.
POSIT reserves the right to review any transaction based upon the request of a Subscriber or on
its own motion and declare any transaction executed by POSIT null and void in the event that the
transaction occurred at a price that was within the numerical guidelines for erroneous
transactions of any exchange or was the result of a significant systems disruption.  In reviewing
transactions resulting from significant systems disruptions, in addition to the price of the
transactions, POSIT may also take into account the volume of transactions as compared to the
normal volume of transactions for the relevant security as executed by POSIT.  POSIT reserves
the right to use its discretion to provide price accommodations in circumstances that are not
clearly errors or erroneous transactions but where the circumstances are appropriate, such as
minor systems latency, to make a price adjustment as an accommodation to an affected client(s).
In these scenarios, the Firm performs an analysis to determine the appropriate price and any
profit or loss as a result of the adjustment is incurred by VAL.
Below are descriptions of the Continuous Crossing Session and the Alert Crossing Session.
      Continuous Crossing Session

POSIT will execute Peg and Day orders against eligible contra-side IOC, Day and Peg
orders. For Peg and Day orders, priority is determined on a price, size, time basis. If a Subscriber
modifies the terms of a previously transmitted order, the order will receive a new order time for
matching purposes (i.e. the order will lose queue spot). The only exception is a reduction in order
quantity which, absent any other changes to the terms of the order, will not update the order time
for matching purposes. Providers receive price improvement. In the case of an IOC order, the
IOC order is always the removing order. In the case of two Peg and/or Day orders, the first in
time is the providing order
Subscribers accessing POSIT directly can request that POSIT apply certain default instructions
or attributes to the Subscriber's orders submitted to POSIT, as described in Part III, Item 7a, and
Part III, Item 14a.
POSIT will execute crosses at prices within the permissible price bands established under the
Limit Up - Limit Down Plan.  POSIT is programmed to prevent executions outside of the Limit
Up - Limit Down price bands.
Subscribers can include MEQ instructions on their orders. In that event, POSIT will not execute
the order in an amount less than such minimum quantity. When the remaining quantity on the
order is less than the MEQ instruction, POSIT will automatically cancel back the remaining
quantity of the order.

	Alert Crossing Session
VAL offers a conditional messaging system known as Alert.  Alert is an anonymous Conditional
Order matching application that exists outside of the POSIT matching engine.  Please see Part
III, Item 9a for a description of Alert.
All sessions
Locked and Crossed Markets: POSIT does not execute in a crossed market, but will execute in
a locked market.  Subscribers have the option of not executing in a locked market at the session
level or via a fix tag.
Price Protection: There are no Price Protection mechanisms.
Short Sales: Subscribers are required to mark short sale orders as "sell short" or "sell short
exempt".  POSIT does not execute short sell orders at the bid price in securities subject to a Reg
SHO Rule 201 price restriction.</taPart3Item11cRulsProcsOfNmsStk>

VAL segments Direct Subscribers into three distinct Liquidity Profiles based upon all of their
filled orders. Direct Subscribers may enter instructions that when present on orders will prevent
interaction with orders from Subscribers who fall into specified Liquidity Profiles. VAL scores
and segments Direct Subscribers at the POSIT Moniker level.  The POSIT Moniker is an internal
subscriber identifier.  A Direct Subscriber can have one or more POSIT Monikers.  Direct
Subscribers with more than one POSIT Moniker have custom order attributes, as described in
Part III, Item 7a, at the session level for each POSIT Moniker.  VAL scores and segments its
own POSIT Monikers. VAL does not score and segment Indirect Subscribers. To the extent that
VAL, its Affiliates or Direct Subscriber's transmit the orders of multiple Indirect Subscribers
through a single POSIT Moniker, the Liquidity Profile will be the composite of all of the Indirect
Subscribers. An exception is that VAL permits Direct Subscribers to have different order flows
scored independently based upon a Segment ID FIX tag. The Current POSIT FIX Specification
Document provides Direct Subscribers the ability to use up to four Segment IDs labeled Segment
1, Segment 2, Segment 3 and Segment 4.
VAL uses a scoring methodology to determine a Subscriber's Liquidity Profiles that is derived
from the price move of a stock from the midpoint price at the time of fill to a weighted average
of individual midpoint prices of durations that range from 10 minutes to 60 minutes after the time of
fill, divided by the stock's spread (a "mark out").  Liquidity Profiles are generated monthly, based
on the prior 3 months of trading activity. There is no de minimis volume rule in the Liquidity
Profile generation.
VAL creates Liquidity Profiles by sorting Subscribers by their mark-out score. The three
Liquidity Profile tiers are called Move Towards, Neutral, and Move Away, where Direct
Subscribers in the Move Towards segment generally produce negative markouts for the contra
where the stock price moves towards the contra (the stock price for buy orders move lower, sell
orders move higher), while subscribers in the Move Away segment generally produce positive
markouts for the contra where the stock price moves away from the contra (the stock price for
buy orders move higher, sell orders move lower).  After sorting Subscribers markout scores from
most negative to most positive, the Liquidity Profiles are constructed such that approximately
20% of the share volume of the most negative markout Subscribers are placed into the Move
Towards category, 60% of the share volume is placed in the Neutral category, 20% of the share
volume of the most positive markout Subscribers are placed in the Move Away category. The
percentages are approximations. Based on the mix of Subscribers' share volume, they may not
perfectly fit into a Segment such that the percentages are exact. VAL will use its discretion in
these circumstances and typically will elect to include more Subscribers in a higher Segment.
Subscribers that submit orders in POSIT can elect to prevent either the Move Towards or Move
Away segments from interacting with their orders on an order by order basis via FIX tag or at a
session level. VAL uses its own discretion to place new Subscribers into one of the three Segments described above. Segment
selection for new Subscribers is based on VAL's subjective judgment of the trading and
investment process employed by the new Subscriber. For new Subscribers that have no prior history trading in POSIT, Segment selection is based on the type of firm, as well as the expected characteristics of the order flow, as specified by the new Subscriber.  For new Subscribers that have a history trading in POSIT (for example, a current Subscriber that wants to set up a new POSIT moniker), Segment selection is based on the type of firm, the expected characteristics of the order flow (as specified by the new Subscriber), as well as the Segment placement of other POSIT Monikers associated with the same underlying Subscriber. VAL reserves the right to move a
Subscriber's liquidity profile bucket intra-month if that Subscriber's mark outs during the month
deviate widely from expected or prior trading activity.
Liquidity Profiles only apply to order interaction in the Continuous Crossing Session and have
no influence on order interaction in the Alert Crossing Session.
Alert Crossing Session
Alert has two types of participants: Human Participants and Electronic Participants.  See Part III,
Item 9a for more detail.</taPart3Item13aSegProcdurDtls>

Virtu Principal Opt Out: Direct and Indirect Subscribers may request to have their orders not
interact with Virtu principal orders. See Part III, Item 7a which lists order instructions including
this instruction.

POSIT Liquidity Profile Interaction: All Direct Subscribers have the option to block either the
Move Towards or Move Away segments for a single order, as described in Part III, Item 13.
Direct Subscribers cannot block both the Move Towards and Move Away segments for a single
order.  Direct Subscribers cannot block the Neutral segment.  VAL programs its algorithms to
use blocking when analysis suggests it may improve execution outcomes. VAL implements the
logic of the algorithms such that decisions are made on specific child orders in specific
circumstances. Indirect Subscribers cannot make decisions to block based on Liquidity Profiles.
Direct subscribers can send instructions designating which Liquidity Profiles to interact with on
an order by order basis via a FIX tag, or set a default at the session level. These Profiles are only
created for the Continuous Crossing Session and only effect counterparty interaction in the
Continuous Crossing Session. See Part III, Item 7a, which  lists order instructions including this
instruction.

Self-Match Prevention: Direct Subscribers may provide instructions that will prevent orders from
crossing if the resulting cross may result in a transaction with no change in beneficial ownership,
as described in Part III, Item 7a. Subscribers can request Self-Match Prevention through their
salesperson, who enter a ticket to make the request. Thereafter, an entry is made in a
configuration file which takes effect in most cases on the next business day, but could take effect
either the same day or greater than the next business day, depending upon the time of day the
request is submitted. Further, Subscribers are able to block interaction against certain Virtu
MPIDs. See Part II, Item 3a for further detail.

Other Order Attributes: Direct Subscribers can place other attributes on orders that could limit an
order's ability to interact with certain contra side interest. These additional attributes include:
Minimum Execution Quantity, Do Not Execute In A Locked Market, and Add Only.  See Part
III, Item 7a for more detail.
Alert:
Participant Type Blocking: Electronic Participants can request to block interaction against
Human Participants via a FIX tag, on an individual order basis.  Human Participants can request
to block interaction against Electronic Participants.  This blocking instruction is supported at the
session level.
Participant and Symbol Specific Blocking: Alert Sales and Coverage personnel can block certain
participants in whole or at a symbol level.  Alert Sales and Coverage personnel apply participant
blocks in whole, or at a symbol level, on an intraday basis if a participant is having a technical
issue. For example, if an Alert participant was duping messages repeatedly then the Alert Sales
and Coverage personnel could introduce a temporary block until the issue was resolved.  Alert
Sales and Coverage personnel can lift this block once the participant verifies the technical issue has been resolved. Additionally, Human Participants can request to block individual symbols.  The Human Participant can make this request through their Alert Sales and Coverage person. Following receipt of a request, the sales person will enter a ticket to make the request. Thereafter, an entry is made in a configuration file which will take effect in most cases on the next business day, but could take effect either the same day or greater than the next business day, depending upon the time of day the request is submitted.  Symbol level blocks are also applied on an automated basis between an
Electronic Participant and a Human Participant, as well as between two Electronic Participants.
If within a two-minute span, for a given symbol, three consecutive invitations to Firm Up
between the two participants result in no trades, a one minute block will be applied between the
two participants in the given symbol.  After the one-minute blocking period, the block between
the two participants will automatically be lifted in the given symbol.   The three-minute time
span begins at the time of when the first invitation is sent.  Symbol level blocks do not carry over
into the next trading day.  Please see Part III, Item 9(a) for more detail on the POSIT Alert
Conditional Order process.
Self-Match Prevention: Subscribers may provide instructions that will prevent orders from
crossing if the resulting cross may result in a transaction with no change in beneficial ownership.</taPart3Item14aCntrPrtyDtls>

      <taPart3Item19aSrvcUsgFees>POSIT does not charge any subscription or connectivity fees. Historically, execution charges, if any, were individually negotiated with each Direct Subscriber. Currently, Direct Subscribers pay fees between $0 and $.05 per share. VAL and VAL Affiliates are not assessed a fee for POSIT trades. Indirect Subscribers pay bundled fees, See Section III, Item 19(b). VAL will consider a number of factors in determining the fee an individual Subscriber will be assessed, including, but not limited to, the client's overall relationship with VAL, the type of trading flow, the amount of trading flow, and the markets that will be traded.</taPart3Item19aSrvcUsgFees>
      <taPart3Item19bBundldSrvcUsgFees>VAL establishes fees for use of its execution products and services, which could include executions in POSIT, on an individual client basis. VAL will consider a number of factors in determining the fee an individual client will be assessed, including, but not limited to, the client's overall relationship with VAL, the type of trading flow, the amount of trading flow, and the markets that will be traded. Client specific clearing arrangements, as specified in Section III, Item 22, are not considered when establishing a fee for that client.</taPart3Item19bBundldSrvcUsgFees>
      <taPart3Item19cRbtDiscOfFees>VAL may pay the cost of cross connects for Direct Subscribers to connect to the NY 5 Hub based upon the overall relationship with the client and or the perceived value of having the Subscriber enter or direct the entry of orders to POSIT.</taPart3Item19cRbtDiscOfFees>
      <taPart3Item20aSuspndProcdur>VAL may in its sole discretion, stop trading certain symbols from time to time for, among other reasons, the purpose of remaining below the volume thresholds for (i) classification as an "SCI Entity" under Regulation SCI and (ii) certain regulatory requirements as set forth in Rules 301(b)(3) and (5) of Regulation ATS.
VAL uses a proprietary market data system to consolidate the best bids and offers to determine the NBBO at which executions occur on POSIT. See Part III, Item 23 for a description of this system. VAL has programmed its market data system to disseminate an alert when it detects a certain level of disparity from normative messages received by the systems. The POSIT system is programmed to shift to utilizing only the SIP BBOs when there is a certain level of disparity between the exchange book feeds and the SIP. If the Firm's Core Operations staff determines that there appears to be a significant delay or issue with the Firm's market data, they will cause POSIT to suspend trading in the impacted symbol or in all symbols in the case that they determine there is a more severe systems issue. In either event, the Core Operations staff will cause POSIT to cancel impacted orders. Cancellation reports will be sent to clients as soon as possible and POSIT's client services personnel will attempt to contact Subscribers. Where there is a severe systems interruption that prevents POSIT from recovering for the remainder of the day, POSIT will instruct Subscribers to route their orders to other market centers.
POSIT will not execute orders if the NBBO is crossed, if the NBB is below the LULD Lower Limit Price Band, if the NBO is above the LULD Upper Limit Price Band, or if the security is in a LULD Trading Pause.
POSIT will reject orders in certain NMS Stocks, including any symbols on VAL's restricted list or symbols for which VAL seeks to remain below certain volume thresholds. In those circumstances POSIT will provide clients with notice of the symbol(s) that will be unavailable by posting information on the POSIT page on the Virtu Financial, Inc. website (http://www.virtu.com).</taPart3Item20aSuspndProcdur>

      <taPart3Item21aMtrlArngmntDtls>VAL reports all POSIT transactions to the FINRA NASDAQ CARTERET TRF.  POSIT does
not have a connection to other FINRA TRFs.  In the event that POSIT is unable to report
transactions to the NASDAQ CARTERET TRF, POSIT will cease trading, cancel existing
orders, and reject new orders.</taPart3Item21aMtrlArngmntDtls>

      <taPart3Item22aMtrlArngmntDtls>VAL is the counterparty to all trades that occur in POSIT and VAL clears and settles with each
counterparty.  Broker-dealer Subscribers are required to be self-clearing or have an
arrangement with a clearing firm.  All transactions are submitted to NSCC for clearance and
settlement.  Subscribers may elect to clear their transactions via a Qualified Service
Representative (QSR) agreement or via an Automated Give-Up (AGU) agreement.    For
Subscribers that are Customers, VAL will settle their transactions through the facilities of the
DTCC via RVP/DVP settlement.  VAL will clear and settle Indirect Subscriber trades in the
same manner as Direct Subscribers.</taPart3Item22aMtrlArngmntDtls>
      <rbPart3Item22bIsMtrlArngmtSameFrAll>Y</rbPart3Item22bIsMtrlArngmtSameFrAll>
      <taPart3Item23aMrktDatSrc>POSIT employs a proprietary market data system that uses a combination of direct market data feeds from
exchanges and market data disseminated by the Securities Information Processors (SIP) to determine the NBBO.  Specifically, POSIT uses direct market data feeds for all exchanges other than LTSE, for which the SIP is used as LTSE does not offer direct market data feeds.  POSIT utilizes this proprietary system to price, prioritize,
and match orders in the POSIT Continuous and POSIT Alert Crossing Sessions, in compliance
with regulations, including Reg NMS and Reg SHO.

SIP data is used as a backup feed, and is used in place of a direct feed from a particular exchange
if that exchange is experiencing a technical issue.  Switching to the SIP data feed is done via an
automated process that compares direct feed data to SIP data.  Additionally, Core Operations
have the ability to switch to the SIP data feed on a discretionary basis.  Switching back to direct
feed data from the SIP data feed is done purely on a discretionary basis, and is performed by the
Core Operations team once this team has confirmed that direct feed data in question is correct.
The SIP data feed is also used for regulatory items, including limit up/limit down bands, trading
halts, and Reg SHO designations.</taPart3Item23aMrktDatSrc>
