        <taPart2Item1aUnitNamesEnterInterest>Virtu Americas, LLC operates POSIT and other business units that can enter or direct the entry
of orders to POSIT or result in an order being entered or directed to POSIT.  The Firm's business
units each use one or more technology platforms that have MPIDs associated with the platform.  A
single business unit can enter or direct orders to the ATS through more than one technology
platform and consequently under more than one MPID.  These business units are described below.
Virtu Electronic Trading ("VET").  VET provides algorithms that are used by clients and the
Firm's business units.  VET algorithms enter or direct the entry of orders to POSIT as agent when
those orders are entered by clients into the algorithms or as principal or riskless principal when
one of the other business units enters orders into the algorithms using the MPIDs: DTTX, GFLO,
VALR, VALX, ITGI and ALTX.   ALTX ("Alternet") cannot enter or direct the entry of orders into the Alert Crossing Session.  See Part III, Item 9a for more detail on the Alert Crossing Session.

Virtu Client Market Making ("VCMM").  VCMM handles held and not held orders transmitted by
other broker-dealers and held orders transmitted by institutions.  The majority of these orders are
SEC Rule 605 eligible orders and are handled and executed on a fully automated basis.  VCMM
sales and trading personnel handle larger and less liquid orders manually and can use VET
algorithms in connection with their market making activities.  VCMM enters or directs the entry of
orders to POSIT as principal, riskless principal and agent to acquire inventory to fill orders or to
acquire positions for its own account using the following MPIDs: NITE, GFLO, VALR and
VALX.
Virtu Institutional Trading ("Institutional Trading").  Institutional Trading handles not held orders
transmitted by institutional clients and facilitates block transactions in single stocks.  Institutional
Trading uses VET algorithms to enter or direct the entry of orders as principal or riskless
principal in connection with its client facilitation activities using the following MPIDs: NITE,
GFLO, VALX and ITGI.
Virtu Hi-Touch Portfolio Trading: Traders on this desk handle not held orders in baskets of
stocks and ETFs. Traders can enter or direct the entry of orders through VAL Electronic Systems
into the ATS as agent under the MPID ITGI.

Virtu ETF Trading ("ETF Trading").  ETF Trading makes markets on exchanges and facilitates
block transactions in exchange traded products for broker-dealer and institutional clients.  ETF
Trading uses VET algorithms to enter or direct the entry of orders as principal or riskless
principal in ETFs and singles stocks using the MPID VALX.
Virtu Principal Market Making ("VPMM"). VPMM is a market maker in NMS equity securities.
VPMM enters or directs the entry of orders as principal to POSIT utilizing the MPID VIRT.</taPart2Item1aUnitNamesEnterInterest>

POSIT under the MPIDs NITE, VIRT and VALX ("the Principal Opt-Out").  Orders entered into
POSIT by VAL under the MPIDs DTTX, GFLO, VALR  and ALTX are not subject to the
Principal Opt-Out.
Subscribers can request the Principal Opt-Out through their sales persons.  Following receipt of a
request, the sales person will enter a ticket to make the request.  Thereafter, an entry is made in a
configuration file which will take effect in most cases on the next business day, but could take
effect either the same day or greater than the next business day, depending upon the time of day
the request is submitted.  When the POSIT matching logic is applied, the configuration file is
checked to determine whether orders are eligible for crossing with VAL or its Affiliate's
principal orders entered under the above referenced MPIDs.  VAL does not allow POSIT
Subscribers to opt out of interacting with any orders submitted to POSIT by VAL or its Affiliates
when they are submitted under any of the other MPIDs referenced in Part II, Item 2(a). The
Principal Opt-Out configuration is applied for all crossing sessions.</taPart2Item3aExplianOptOut>

        <taPart2Item6aUnitAfflEmployeeServices>VAL does not have any personnel whose sole responsibility is for POSIT.  The Firm considers
information relating to Subscriber's live orders, trading interests and recent executions in POSIT
that the Firm reasonably believes may suggest a Subscriber continues at that moment in time to
have the same or additional live orders and trading interests in POSIT, to be ATS confidential
information ("Confidential Information").  As is more fully discussed in Part III, Item 7(a), VAL
does not consider all post trade data to be Confidential Information, particularly when the
information is anonymized, aggregated or both.
Below is a summary of the shared personnel that provide services to both POSIT, VAL, and its
Affiliates and have access to Confidential Information.
*	Compliance and Legal:  Compliance and Legal personnel support all of the Firm's
business units and those of the Firm's Affiliates and perform a variety of compliance and
legal activities related to their roles.  They have access to Subscriber historical order and
execution information and as necessary they can be provided with access to intra-day
information.
*	Finance and Management Reporting Group:  Finance and management reporting
personnel support all of the Firm's business units and those of the Firm's Affiliates.
These personnel are involved in accounting, billing, analyzing revenues, and providing
management reporting information.  They have access to Subscribers' historical post-
trade execution information and data.
*	Operations:  Operations personnel support the Firm's middle and back office processes
for clearance and settlement and related activities and have access to Subscribers' real
time intra-day, post-trade, and historical execution information for clearing, settlement,
and regulatory reporting purposes.
*	Core Operations:  Core Operations are technical personnel who have access to the Firm's
and its Affiliates' trading infrastructure, which includes POSIT, to monitor the
functionality, health, and wellness of the Firm's trading infrastructure and take action as
necessary to maintain the systems and manage issues.  They have access to Subscribers'
real-time and historical order and execution information.  This group supports all trading
infrastructure and applications for the Firm.
*	Software Developers:  Software Developers have access to the Firm's and its Affiliates'
trading infrastructure, which includes POSIT, to maintain and enhance the software for
the Firm's trading applications.  They have access to Subscribers' real-time and historical
order and execution information.  This group supports all trading infrastructure and
applications for the Firm.
*	Product Management: Product Management are personnel who manage the day-to-day
business activities for products such as POSIT, the algorithms the Firm provides to
clients, and other trading-related applications VAL and its Affiliates provide to clients.
These personnel monitor the trading applications, enhance their product features, and
create new features.  Product Management compile and analyze statistics and metrics
related to the ATS and other electronic products and services.  Product Management
works with Software Developers, and in some instances are also Software Developers
themselves.  The Product Manager responsible for supervising POSIT is also the Product
Manager responsible for supervising VAL's other ATS, MatchIt, and also provides
support to both VAL's Affiliates' execution services applications. Product Management
have access to Subscribers' real-time and historical order and execution information.
*	Relationship Management:  Relationship Management personnel are responsible for
managing the Firm's relationship with its clients, including clients who are Direct
Subscribers of the ATS, and for cross-selling the Firm's other products and services.
They have access to historical order and execution information.
*	Sales and/or Trading personnel:  To the extent Sales or Trading personnel are responsible
for handling an order, a portion of which is directed to POSIT as a child order, such
personnel would have real time access to such child order and any of its executions in
POSIT analogous to the access they would have to information about orders and
executions that were directed to external market centers in order to monitor executions
and provide order-related services.
*	POSIT Alert ("Alert") Sales and Coverage: The Firm offers an application called Alert
that is a conditional order application which resides outside of the POSIT Matching
engine and which transmit orders to the Alert Crossing Session to consummate trades.
See Part III, Item 9 and 11 for further descriptions of Alert and the Alert Crossing
Session.  Alert Sales and Coverage personnel are responsible for the sales and day-to-day
coverage of Alert.  Alert Sales and Coverage personnel have access to a front end
application called Phoenix, which displays real-time order and execution information of
Alert participants.  See, Part III, Item 9 for further discussion about Alert.  This group can
access Alert participants' real-time and historical order and execution information, but do
not have access to any real-time or historical order and execution information in POSIT's
matching engines for the Continuous Crossing Session or the Agency Close Crossing
Session.
*	Analytics Personnel: Analytics Personnel provide transaction cost analysis data and
consultancy to institutional investors.  This group is separate from the business units of
the broker dealer operator that enter or direct the entry of orders and trading interest into
POSIT, as defined in Part II, Item 1(a). The Firm offers a product called the Analytics
Portal ("the Portal") that provides pre-trade, real-time and post-trade analytics to the
Firm's clients.  In order to enable and support client trade reporting in the Portal,
Analytics personnel have access to real-time order and execution information for Alert
participants. This group can access Alert participants' real-time and historical order and
execution information, but do not have access to any real-time or historical order and
execution information in POSIT's matching engines for the Continuous Crossing Session
or the Agency Close Crossing Session. See Part III, Item 9 for further discussion about
Alert.</taPart2Item6aUnitAfflEmployeeServices>

      <taPart2Item7aDescrOfSafeGaurdsAndProcedures>GENERAL BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Firm
operates POSIT on a matching engine that runs on a standalone server in the NY5 Data Center.
See Part I, Item 7; and Part III, Item 6(a).  The POSIT matching engine communicates with
shared systems to book trades, to report executed trades to the tape, to facilitate clearance and
settlement, for financial reporting and billing, and to facilitate other post-trade processes.  The
Firm operates the Alert application on servers that are separate from the POSIT matching engine.
These systems contain Confidential Information.  See Part II, Item 6 for information on
personnel that have access to Confidential Information.
AGGREGATED ANONYMOUS DATA.  Data which has been aggregated and which does not
identify any Subscribers is not Confidential Information ("Aggregated Anonymous Data").  The
Firm publishes firm-wide aggregated anonymous execution data to market wide trade
advertisement systems after the transaction has been reported to the consolidated tape.  The data
does not include any client identities but does include symbol level executed volumes.  While the
Firm does not consider this data to be Confidential Information, it does not include POSIT
Aggregated Anonymous Data in these reports.
The Firm posts monthly statistics on its website and disseminates this data to Subscribers ("the
Monthly POSIT and Alert Statistics").  The Monthly POSIT and Alert Statistics are available at
https://www.virtu.com/about/transparency and provide aggregate and anonymous information
about POSIT and Alert, including total volume; volume by sector; volume by market cap; fill
size distribution; distribution of Alert block size, and distribution of executions at the bid, mid
and offer.  The Firm produces market commentary from time-to-time that discusses general
market trends.  The statistical data described in this paragraph can be used to produce market
commentary.  The Firm considers this data to be Aggregated Anonymous Data and not
Confidential Information.  The Firm does not permit Subscribers to opt out of having their data
included in these reports.
SALES DATA.  Sales Data is aggregated information about the products and services the Firm's
clients use and includes the client's name, the product or service they use, aggregate executed
volume, and revenues ("Sales Data").  Sales Data includes aggregated ATS data as described in
the preceding sentence.  The Firm provides Sales Data to management personnel, Sales or
Trading personnel, Relationship Management personnel and Alert Sales and Coverage personnel
who are involved in handling relationships with the Firm's clients.  Sales Data is provided for the
purpose of allowing these personnel to keep abreast of the client's business activities to manage
the client relationship and to cross sell the Firm's products and services to the client.  The Firm
does not consider Sales Data to be Confidential Information when distributed internally for the
above described purposes.  The Firm makes this information available in end of day reports and
in sales systems (i.e., systems that support activities of Sales or Trading personnel, Relationship
Management personnel and Alert Sales and Coverage personnel for the purposes described
above) on T+1.  The Firm prohibits personnel from disclosing Sales Data to third parties.  The
Firm does not permit Subscribers to opt out of having this data made available to personnel
involved handling client relationships, as defined in Part II, Item 6(a).
PERSONNEL WITH ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The Firm does not
have any personnel whose sole responsibility is for the operations of POSIT.  The shared
personnel discussed in response to Part II, Item 6(a), have access to Confidential Information.
SAFEGUARDS AND OVERSEEING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The Firm maintains
written policies and procedures regarding use and protection of Confidential Information.  Firm
personnel are subject to its parent, Virtu Financial Inc.'s Code of Conduct and Employee Manual.
Firm personnel are also subject to the Firm's Information Security Policy, Compliance Manual,
and Written Supervisory Procedures.
These policies prohibit the personnel listed in Part II, Item 6(a), from sharing Confidential
Information with other personnel who are not in one of these permitted categories or with any
other person.  The exception is that Compliance and Legal personnel may provide information to
regulators in response to regulatory requests or to third parties pursuant to subpoena.  Personnel
who violate the Firm's policies concerning Confidential Information are subject to discipline,
including termination of their employment.  The Firm performs email reviews and employs data
loss software as a means of safeguarding Confidential Information.
The Firm procedures require that personnel make requests for access to its systems through the
Firm's access ticketing system and to receive approval from a supervisor prior to being granted
access to any systems.  The Firm's supervisory personnel grant access to systems on the premise
that it is necessary to perform their duties and to carry out the purpose for which the information
is provided to them.  The supervisor responsible for POSIT and Alert approves requests for
access to the POSIT matching engine and Alert application.  The Firm only permits approved
personnel in the categories described in Part II, Item 6(a), to have access to Confidential
Information and only permits these personnel to access the systems and the Confidential
Information contained therein using approved means of access and credentials.  Supervisors do
not grant access to Confidential Information. The Firm maintains a process that sends
notifications to designated personnel to disable systems access for personnel who are no longer
employed by the Firm.  Supervisors are responsible for instructing the technology personnel to
disable access when employees change roles.  The Firm provides reports to the supervisors that
show personnel with access to the POSIT matching engine and Alert application on a monthly
basis.  Supervisors review these reports to ensure that these personnel still require access to carry
out responsibilities related to the ATS.
PERSONAL TRADING RESTRICTIONS.  The Firm maintains employee trading policies that
require personnel to disclose their own personal accounts and the accounts of close family
members, that prohibit personnel from trading based on any client Confidential Information, that
require personnel to pre-clear transactions and attest at the time of trade entry that they are not
trading on Confidential Information, and that prescribe holding periods for securities purchases.
The Firm conducts reviews of employee trading to determine whether trades were pre-cleared
and whether holding periods were observed.</taPart2Item7aDescrOfSafeGaurdsAndProcedures>
      <part2Item7bCanSubscriberConsentToDisclosure rbPart2Item7bCanSubscriberConsentToDisclosure="Y">
        <taPart2Item7bExplainHowAndConditions>By virtue of their use of POSIT, VAL considers all Subscribers to have consented to the
disclosure of Confidential Information as described in Part II, Item 6(a) and consented to the
disclosure of Aggregated Anonymous Data to the public and Sales Data to management
personnel, Sales or Trading personnel, Relationship Management personnel and Alert Sales and
Coverage personnel internally as described in Part II, Item 7(a) above.
Subscribers may consent to disclosure of their own Confidential Information to any person they
choose by submitting a written request to their Sales or Trading person, Relationship
Management person or Alert Sales and Coverage person describing the nature of the information
the wish to disclose and the scope of the disclosure they wish to make.  For example, a
Subscriber may wish to request that their data be disclosed to a Sales or Trading person to
monitor their activity or for analysis.</taPart2Item7bExplainHowAndConditions>
        <part2Item7cCanSubscriberWithdrawConsent rbPart2Item7cCanSubscriberWithdrawConsent="Y">
          <taPart2Item7cExplainHowAndConditions>To the extent a Subscriber has made a request to disclose Confidential Information that is ongoing,
See Part II, Item 7(b), or wishes to opt out of the disclosure of Aggregated Anonymous Data that
is reported market-wide dissemination systems, See Part II, Item 7(a), the subscriber may submit
a written request to their sales person.   The sales person will create a ticket for operation staff to
carry out the request.  In most cases, the request will be honored on the next business day, but
could take effect either the same day or greater than the next business day, depending upon the
time of day the request is submitted.  Sales and Operations will verify that the request has been
implemented.
Otherwise, VAL does not permit Subscribers to opt out of having their Aggregated Anonymous
Data included in the Monthly POSIT and Alert Statistics, in market commentary that uses this
data, or from having Sales Data provided to management personnel, Sales or Trading personnel,
Relationship Management personnel and Alert Sales and Coverage personnel, for the purposes
noted in Part II, Item 6(a).</taPart2Item7cExplainHowAndConditions>

      <taPart2Item7dSummaryOfRolesRespOfPersons>The shared personnel described in response to Part II, Item 6(a) have access to Confidential
Information, as described in Part II, Item 6(a). These personnel have access to that information
for the purpose of carrying out their job functions.
To the extent Sales and Trading Personnel direct orders to the ATS, those orders and related
executions are available to Sales and Trading Personnel who may analyze the data for the
purposes of understanding the performance of the algorithms.
As described in Part II, Item 7(a), the Firm makes public Aggregated Anonymous Data to further
the Firm's efforts to market its products and services.  The Firm does not consider Aggregated
Anonymous Data to be Confidential Information.  The Firm provides Sales Data to management
personnel, Sales or Trading personnel, Relationship Management personnel and Alert Sales and
Coverage personnel so that they may keep abreast of their clients' activities and coordinate the
Firm's sales efforts.  The Firm does not make this information available to third parties.  The
Firm does not consider Sales Data to be Confidential Information when it is provided to
management personnel, Sales or Trading personnel, Relationship Management personnel and Alert
Sales and Coverage personnel or these purposes.</taPart2Item7dSummaryOfRolesRespOfPersons>

        <taPart3Item2bSummaryOfCndtns>The Firm permits applicants who satisfy certain eligibility requirements to become Direct
Subscribers.  Direct Subscribers must be institutional investors or broker dealers.  Additionally,
Direct Subscribers must execute an electronic access agreement, and submit the standard on-
boarding documentation that all clients of the Firm must submit.  Such documentation includes
"know your customer" information, financial information to assess counterparty risk and
establish a trading limit, and relevant agreements such as Agreements to Give Up ("AGU") or
Qualified Service Representative Agreements ("QSR") to facilitate trade clearance.  The Firm
performs reviews to assess a client's prior disciplinary history.  A disciplinary history related to
market abuse, for example, would potentially preclude a prospective client from being on-
boarded to VAL and consequently would preclude the client from being permitted access to the
ATS.
The Firm evaluates factors such as an institutional investor's assets and assets under
management, a broker-dealer's net capital and its clearing firm's net capital to the extent a
broker-dealer is not self-clearing, and credit ratings in making on-boarding determinations.
Institutions must meet the FINRA definition of Institutional Investor.  For Broker-Dealers the
Firm doesn't have a specific net capital requirement, but will consider the nature of the business
flow, whether there will be large mark-to-market exposures, anticipated revenues provide
sufficient risk vs. reward ratios, whether the Subscriber is part of a larger group and there are
explicit or implicit guarantees. For non-Broker-Dealers that do not meet one of the criteria to be
defined as an Institutional Investor, exceptions may be granted is there is a degree of confidence
the company will grow and meet the definition of institutional investor in the future.  The
Product Manager for the ATS approves or denies access to the ATS.  Clients who are not
approved for access to the ATS would generally also not be approved for any other VAL
services.
The Firm requires Indirect Subscribers to go through the same on-boarding process.  The Firm
only on-boards clients who use its EMS, algorithms, and Alert that are broker-dealers or
institutional type clients and does not accept natural persons as clients.</taPart3Item2bSummaryOfCndtns>

POSIT accepts Peg orders and Immediate or Cancel ("IOC") orders.  Peg orders may execute
against contra-side Peg orders or against IOC orders. IOC orders may only execute against
contra-side Peg orders. These order types may be entered with other instructions, as described
below, that will be used by the matching algorithm to determine whether and how they will
interact with other orders.
(1) Peg Orders: Peg orders remain open until executed, canceled by the Subscriber or until the
end of the daily matching session. Peg orders can be designated with the following execution
instruction:
      (i) Market: A Market instruction designates that a buy order can be executed up to the
national best offer and a sell order can be executed down to the national best bid.
      (ii) Mid-Point: A Mid-Point instruction designates that an order can be executed up to the
mid-point between the national best bid and national best offer ("NBBO").
      (iii) Primary: A Primary instruction designates that the order can only be executed at the
national best bid in the case of a buy order and the national best offer in the case of a sell order.
      (iv.) Limit Price: A Limit Price instruction specifies a price above which a buy order and
below which a sell order that the order will not be eligible for execution.
(2) IOC Orders: IOC orders will either execute if an eligible contra side order exists against
which the order can be executed or if not the order is canceled.  Subscribers may enter IOC
orders with Market, Mid-Point and Limit Price instructions.

Subscribers can include Minimum Execution Quantity ("MEQ") instructions on their orders via
FIX, which specifies the minimum number of shares that must be available for a contra side
order to be eligible for execution.

Subscribers can also request to apply the following instructions on their orders at the session
level:

(i)	Locked Market: Direct and Indirect Subscribers may request a Locked Market
instruction, which specifies that an order is not eligible for execution during
locked markets. IOC orders entered with a Locked Market instruction will be
rejected if the NBBO is locked. Peg orders will be accepted but ineligible for
execution until the NBBO unlocks.

(ii)	Virtu Principal Opt-Out: Direct and Indirect Subscribers may request to have
their orders not interact with Virtu principal. This instruction will only prevent
interaction against orders entered by VAL under the MPID's NITE, VIRT and
VALX.  Principal orders entered by VAL or the Affiliates using other MPIDs
will not be subject to this opt out.  See Part 2, Item 3b for more detail.

(iii)	MEQ Instruction Non-Aggregation: Direct and Indirect Subscribers may
request that multiple orders are not aggregated to meet a MEQ instruction.  By
default, POSIT will aggregate orders to meet a Subscriber's MEQ instruction.

(iv)	Cancel Residual if Below MEQ Instruction: Direct and Indirect Subscribers
may request that a residual quantity be canceled back to the Subscriber if the
residual quantity is less than the Subscriber's MEQ instruction.  By default,
POSIT will not cancel back an order if the residual is less than the MEQ
instruction.

(v)	Default Peg Instructions: Direct and Indirect Subscribers may request that their
IOC and/or Day orders have a Default Peg instruction.


An order that contains a value in a utilized FIX field other than a value recognized by VAL (as
described in its FIX specifications) will be rejected.  An order containing a value in a non-
utilized FIX field will be accepted, but that instruction will not be processed.
Subscribers can route orders to the Agency Close Crossing Session, which are subject to specific
time-in-force and order type attributes, as described in Part III, Item 17.
For resting Peg orders, priority in POSIT is based on the price instruction, i.e. market, mid, or
primary. Resting Peg orders that can be executed at the same price receive a pro rata share
allocation.  However, POSIT will always attempt to execute at the midpoint of the NBBO, prior
to executing at the NBB or NBO.  Resting Peg orders with market instructions on the same side
of the market will execute at the midpoint in a pro rata share allocation along with resting Peg
orders with midpoint instructions also on the same side of the market.  Peg orders with primary
instructions, cannot execute at the midpoint, and would not participate and receive shares in a
pro rata allocation when there are resting Peg orders with market and or midpoint price
instructions on the same side.
For IOC orders and Peg orders that remove liquidity, these orders are processed one at a time in
time sequence. The following examples illustrate the matching process, assuming there are no
instructions that would prevent an execution such as MEQ or a Limit Price that would be an
order ineligible based upon the current NBBO.
Example 1:
Market bid/offer: $10.00 x $10.10
In POSIT, Order 1 is a Midpoint Peg order to buy 1,000 shares and Order 2 is a Market Peg
order to buy 1,000 shares.  An in-bound Peg order or IOC order with market or midpoint
instructions to sell 1,000 shares is entered into POSIT.  An execution of 1000 shares will occur at
midpoint, with Order 1 receiving 500 shares, and Order 2 receiving 500 shares.
Example 2:
Market bid/offer: $10.00 x $10.10
In POSIT, Order 1 is a Midpoint Peg order to buy 1,000 shares and Order 2 is a Primary Peg
order to buy 1,000 shares.  An in-bound Peg order or IOC order with market or midpoint
instructions to sell 1,000 shares is entered into POSIT.  An execution of 1000 shares will occur at
midpoint of the NBBO, with Order 1 receiving 1000 shares and Order 2 receiving no shares.
Alert Crossing Session
The Alert Crossing Session supports all of the order types and instructions described in the
Continuous Crossing Session section in Part III, Item 7(a), with the exception that the Alert
Crossing Session does not accept IOC orders. Additionally, the below order type instructions are
only available in the Alert Crossing Session.
(i) 	Conditional Indicator: Peg orders entered into the Alert Crossing Session are by
default designated as Conditional Orders. Conditional Orders are not firm and
must respond affirmatively to an Invitation to Firm-Up from the Alert Crossing
Session by transmitting a Firm-Up Response Order to be eligible to be executed
against contra-side orders.
(ii) 	Firm-Up Response Order: These orders are entered in response to invitations
from the Alert Crossing Session.
(iii)	Auto-Ex: Human Participants, as described in Part III, Item 9(a), can designate a
Conditional Order as Auto-Ex.  If the Auto-Ex instruction is enabled for a
Conditional Order, the Human Participant will not receive a pop up window
requesting to Firm-Up, as described in Part III, Item 9(a), but instead the
Conditional Order from the Human Participant will automatically Firm-Up
against a contra side order.
See Part III, Item 9a for more detail on the Alert Crossing Session.
Agency Close Crossing Session
For the Agency Close Crossing session, Subscribers can only submit Peg orders with a Market
Peg instruction and a time in force of close.  See Part III, Item 11(c) for more detail on the
Agency Close Crossing Session.</taPart3Item7AOrdrTypExplain>

      <part3Item9aMsgDtls rbPart3Item9aIsAnyMsgToIndicTI="Y">
        <taPart3Item9aMsgUsgDtls>VAL offers a conditional messaging system known as Alert.  Alert is an anonymous
Conditional Order matching application that exists outside of the POSIT matching engine.
Alert has two types of participants: Human Participants and Electronic Participants.  Alert has
three message types: A Conditional Order; an Invitation to Firm-Up; and a Firm-Up Response
Order.
Human Participants install Alert software, which can be installed on a variety of OMS or EMS
systems, on their systems.  The Alert software takes in information about Human Participants
orders resident in the OMS or EMS and transmits that information to the Alert matching
application in the form of a Conditional Order.  Alert Human Participants configure the
frequency at which the Alert software takes in information about orders resident in their OMS or
EMS.  The Alert software also provides Alert participants with a graphical user interface ("the
Alert Front End") that allows users to see pending Conditional Orders and respond to Invitations
to Firm-Up. Human Participants can manually respond to Firm-Up Requests or configure the
Alert software to automatically respond.  For Human Participants, Alert will send the Invitation
to Firm-Up to the Alert Front End via a pop up window, requesting the Human Participant to
Firm-Up.  The pop up window indicates that a contra order exists in a given symbol, but does not
provide any size or price information of the contra order.  For an execution to occur, the Human
Participant must respond to the pop-up window by submitting a Firm-Up Response.  The one
exception to this workflow is for Human Participants who have enabled Auto-Ex on their order,
which is described in Part III, Item 7a. The Auto-Ex order instruction can only be set by the
Human Participant in the Alert software.  The Auto-Ex instruction will remain in effect until one
of the following occurs: 1. The Huma Participant turns off Auto-Ex on the order, 2. The Human
Participant is fully filled on the Auto-Ex order, 3. The trading day ends. The Alert software will
the send a Firm-Up Response Order from the Human Participant's EMS to VAL for submission
to the POSIT ATS Alert Crossing Session that references the invitation and matches the
attributes of the invitation in terms of symbol, side and quantity. Human Participants can change
order quantities up or down prior to submitting a Firm-Up Response.  VAL's agency desks and
clients of its Affiliates cannot use the Alert Front End to view and interact with conditional
interests.  They are Electronic Participants and can only send orders to algorithms that can send
Conditional Orders through Alert.
Electronic Participants do not install Alert software.  Rather, Electronic Participants transmit
Conditional Orders directly to the Alert matching application through the Electronic
Participant's algorithm or electronic system.   Alert will send an Invitation to Firm-Up to the
algorithm or system that entered a Conditional Order when a potential matching opportunity
exists.  Hereinafter, Electronic Participant and algorithm or system shall have the same
meaning.  For an execution to occur, the Electronic Participant must respond to the invitation
by transmitting a Firm-Up Response Order.  Alert will transmit an Invitation to Firm-Up to the
Electronic Participant containing the same number of shares included in the Electronic
Participant's original Conditional Order.  The Electronic Participant may then respond by
sending a Firm-Up Response Order to VAL for submission to the POSIT ATS Alert Crossing
Session that references the invitation and matches the attributes of the invitation in terms of
symbol, side and quantity.  The Electronic Participant may transmit a Firm-Up Response Order
with a quantity that is less or more than the invited quantity.  An execution will occur to the
extent that Firm-Up Response Orders are received by POSIT within the designated response
time, subject to other instructions placed on the orders by the participant, as described in Part III
item 7.  All business units and affiliates of the broker dealer operator that enter or direct the
entry of orders into POSIT ALERT are considered Electronic Participants, and are not treated
any differently than Electronic Participants external to the broker dealer operator.
When multiple Conditional Orders are present on the same side and same symbol, the Alert
matching application will give invitation priority in the following order: Human Participant
with Auto-Ex enabled, Human Participant without Auto-Ex enabled, Electronic Participant.
When two participants are on the same side and fall within the same participant type (i.e., two
Human Participants with Auto-Ex enabled, two Human Participants without Auto-Ex enabled,
or two Electronic Participants), the Alert matching application will use order size as the second
order of invitation priority.  For example, if two Human Participants are present on the same
side and same symbol, and a single contra order is submitted, the Human Participant with the
largest order size will receive an invitation message.  Lastly, if two participants are on the same
side, fall within the same participant type, and have the same order size, order submission time
will be used as the third order of priority to determine which participant would receive the
invitation.
The response time to the Invitation to Firm-Up is a function of the type of participants invited.
Electronic Participants must respond within 1 second, while Human Participants without Auto-
Ex enabled have 30 seconds to respond.  Participants who do not respond within these time
frames will not be eligible to participate in the match.
Alert invites all participants in the potential match simultaneously, except as described below.
When an Electronic Participant has a potential match against a Human Participant, the Human
Participant will receive the Invitation to Firm-Up first.  Once the Human Participant firms up,
an Invitation to Firm-Up is then sent to the Electronic Participant.  If the Human Participant
does not firm up, the Electronic Participant will not receive an Invitation to Firm-Up.

In addition to the messaging described above to Alert participants, Alert will transmit
information to POSIT on the potential Alert match.  At the time Invitations to Firm-Up are sent
to participants, Alert sends the following information to POSIT on the potential Alert match: 1)
Number of buyers, 2) Number of sellers, 3) Number of Human Participants, 4) Symbol, 5)
Response timer.  POSIT will run the match at the earlier of when all participants submit firm up
orders to POSIT or the expiration of the response timer.
After the completion of the match, or the expiration of the response timer, POSIT will transmit
information on the outcome of the match back to Alert.  This information is stored to log files
that are consumed by a front end application called Phoenix.  Phoenix is used by Alert Sales and
Coverage personnel to monitor client orders in Alert, as described in Part II, Item 6a.
Upon request, POSIT will apply a maximum notional value constraint, set by the Alert
participant, to an Alert participant's order. In addition, upon request, POSIT will aggregate an
Alert participant's orders for execution. Where such Alert orders have a common MEQ
instruction, POSIT will apply the MEQ instruction on the aggregated Alert order.</taPart3Item9aMsgUsgDtls>

types of orders POSIT will accept prior to the start of regular trading hours or during a trading
halt; however, IOC orders will be cancelled back and Peg orders will remain on the POSIT order
book until trading begins. Unexecuted orders will be cancelled at the market's closing time.
POSIT does not have an opening auction or any specific procedures to reopen after a halt of
trading.  Peg orders will remain on the book during a trading halt, and be prioritized by price, pro

      <taPart3Item11aStrucOfNmsStk>POSIT is an equity crossing system providing a continuous trading environment in all NMS
stocks for orders received by POSIT through a variety of means, both direct and indirect, as
described in response to Part III, Item 5.  POSIT operates three general crossing sessions: (i) the
Continuous Crossing Session; (ii) the Alert Crossing Session; and (iii) the Agency Close
Crossing Session. Each of these crossing sessions is described in detail in response to Part III,
Item 11(c).  POSIT's methodology for crossing is price and then pro rata split, as described in
Part III, Item 7(a).  All NMS stocks are eligible for trading in POSIT.  POSIT may, in its sole
discretion, stop trading certain symbols for, among other reasons, the purpose of remaining
below the volume thresholds for (i) classification as an "SCI Entity" under Regulation SCI and
(ii) certain regulatory requirements as set forth in Rules 301(b)(3) and (5) of Regulation ATS.</taPart3Item11aStrucOfNmsStk>

      <taPart3Item11cRulsProcsOfNmsStk>POSIT operates three crossing sessions: (i) the Continuous Crossing Session, (iii) the Alert
Crossing Session (ii) the Agency Close Crossing Session, and.  POSIT offers the ability to
participate in the three crossing sessions to all Subscribers. Note, the rules and procedures
applicable to the Continuous Crossing Session apply to the other crossing sessions unless
otherwise stated.  Subscribers can specify which session to route an order to via a specific FIX
tag.  POSIT's methodology for crossing is that priority is based on price and then eligible orders
receive allocations based on a pro rata split, as described in Part III, Item 7a.  If shares cannot be
evenly split on a pro rata basis, then POSIT will randomly choose an order to receive a smaller
allocation.
POSIT reserves the right to review any transaction based upon the request of a Subscriber or on
its own motion and declare any transaction executed by POSIT null and void in the event that the
transaction occurred at a price that was within the numerical guidelines for erroneous
transactions of any exchange or was the result of a significant systems disruption.  In reviewing
transactions resulting from significant systems disruptions, in addition to the price of the
transactions, POSIT may also take into account the volume of transactions as compared to the
normal volume of transactions for the relevant security as executed by POSIT.  POSIT reserves
the right to use its discretion to provide price accommodations in circumstances that are not
clearly errors or erroneous transactions but where the circumstances are appropriate, such as
minor systems latency, to make a price adjustment as an accommodation to an affected client(s).
In these scenarios, the Firm performs an analysis to determine the appropriate price and any
profit or loss as a result of the adjustment is incurred by VAL.
Below are descriptions of the Continuous Crossing Session, the Agency Close Crossing Session,
and the Alert Crossing Session.
      Continuous Crossing Session
During the Continuous Crossing Session, Subscribers may only enter orders that are Peg or IOC
order types.  Peg orders can be submitted to POSIT beginning at 8:00 a.m. and through the
trading day until the market closes at 4:00 p.m. and are held in POSIT's order book until they are
executed, cancelled or until they expire.  When a Peg order is submitted to POSIT, the system
scans for available liquidity to determine whether there is a contra-side Peg order residing in the
system.  If there is no contra-side Peg order in POSIT, the Peg order will continue to rest in
POSIT until executed or cancelled and returned. Peg orders in POSIT will execute immediately
with contra-side IOC orders, unless one of the orders' instructions make it ineligible for
execution.  Peg orders can be executed against contra-side Peg orders and/or IOC orders;
however, IOC orders can only be executed against Peg orders.  POSIT cancels unexecuted Peg
orders in accordance with the instructions of the submitting Subscriber, or by default at the close
of regular trading in the market. If a Peg order expires without being fully or partially filled, the
Subscriber submitting that order receives a "nothing done" report. IOC orders are immediately
executed or immediately canceled upon receipt.  For Subscribers' orders that partially executed
during the Continuous Crossing Session, the residual shares will be cancelled back to the
Subscriber after the close of trading.
POSIT only executes orders at the midpoint of the NBBO, the NBO or the NBB.  In the first
instance, POSIT will attempt to cross eligible orders at the midpoint of the NBBO.  If midpoint
pricing is unavailable, POSIT will then look to other matching opportunities at the NBB or NBO,
as applicable.
Subscribers accessing POSIT directly can request that POSIT apply certain default instructions
or attributes to the Subscriber's orders submitted to POSIT, as described in Part III, Item 7(a),
and Part III, Item 14a.
POSIT will execute crosses at prices within the permissible price bands established under the
Limit Up - Limit Down Plan.  POSIT is programmed to prevent executions outside of the Limit
Up ? Limit Down price bands.
Subscribers can include MEQ instructions on their orders. In that event, POSIT will not execute
the order in an amount less than such minimum quantity.  However, when the remaining quantity
on the order is less than the MEQ instruction, POSIT will not automatically cancel back the
remaining quantity of the order, but will attempt to execute that unfilled portion in a single
execution.  Subscribers can also instruct that their orders only execute against a single contra that
meets the MEQ instruction for their order, as described in Part III, Item 7(a).  If Subscribers do
not request this, POSIT's default behavior is to consolidate contra interest to meet a Subscriber's
MEQ Instruction.  Subscribers can request that POSIT always cancel remaining shares after an
execution where the remaining quantity on the order is less than the MEQ, as described in Part
III, Item 7a.
Where multiple resting orders have a MEQ instruction specified by the Subscriber, POSIT can
alter the pro-rata formula to allow an execution when one might otherwise not occur:
*	In that circumstance pro-rata reallocation ratio is 80/20.  This means that if an order is
getting 1000 shares as per initial pro-rata calculation, 80% (800 shares) will be allocated, and
20% (200 shares) can be used to satisfy the minimum shares of other, larger orders with a
minimum quantity size.  In certain instances, the reallocation will result on one resting order
being filled with all of the eligible shares and the other order(s) receiving no allocation.
*	There is a threshold above which the 80/20 rule applies. Orders with pro-rata allocations
equal to or less than 200 shares are not guaranteed any allocation.
If multiple orders do not meet their MEQ instructions in the initial allocation, order size priority
is used as a tie-breaker to allocate additional shares to satisfy MEQ instructions.
Please see Attachment 11(c) for illustrative examples.
	Alert Crossing Session conform
VAL offers a conditional messaging system known as Alert.  Alert is an anonymous Conditional
Order matching application that exists outside of the POSIT matching engine.  Please see Part
III, Item 9a for a description of Alert.
      Agency Close Crossing Session
Subscribers can instruct the Firm to enter an order into the Agency Close Crossing Session via a
FIX tag.  The Agency Close Crossing Session only accepts Market orders.  POSIT will reject
Limit orders. Only buy and sell orders are accepted; short sell orders will be rejected. POSIT will
only accept orders for the Agency Close Crossing Session between 3:50:01pm ? 4:00pm EST.
Orders sent outside of this time frame will be rejected.  The closing price for each security will
be the closing price disseminated to POSIT from the primary exchange data feed.  Subscribers
will receive indicative fills ahead of the close as soon as there is a match. Portions of the Agency
Close Crossing orders that have not yet been indicatively matched may be cancelled at any time
up to 4:00PM EST.  POSIT will reject orders submitted to the Agency Close Crossing Session if
the security is halted or paused at the time of submission. If a cross cannot be consummated
because a security is halted or paused or the primary closing price for the security is not
published by the primary exchange for any reason, POSIT will cancel any indicative fills and
return the unfilled portion of the affected orders.
All sessions
Locked and Crossed Markets: POSIT does not execute in a crossed market, but will execute in
a locked market.  Subscribers have the option of not executing in a locked market at the session
level.
Price Protection: There are no Price Protection mechanisms.
Short Sales: Subscribers are required to mark short sale orders as "sell short" or "sell short
exempt".  POSIT does not execute short sell orders at the bid price in securities subject to a Reg
SHO Rule 201 price restriction.</taPart3Item11cRulsProcsOfNmsStk>

Contra Participant Specific Blocking: Subscribers can request to block interaction with specific
Subscribers within POSIT.  Upon request, execution performance reports can be provided to
Subscribers on their order flow, grouped by contra Subscriber, time in force, and peg instruction.
Metrics included in the execution performance reports can include, but is not limited to, shares
executed, average trade size, and stock price movement after the time of fill (mark outs).  Contra
Subscribers are anonymized in the execution performance reports.  Upon receiving this
information, a Subscriber can request which anonymized contra Subscribers to block interaction
against, either in totality, or can specify specific contra Subscriber blocking by time in force
and/or peg instructions.  Once a Subscriber specifies a contra Subscriber block, that block will
remain in effect until the Subscriber requests for that block to be removed. Subscribers can
request Contra Participant Specific Blocking through their salesperson, who enter a ticket to
make the request.  Thereafter, an entry is made in a configuration file which takes effect in most
cases on the next business day, but could take effect either the same day or greater than the next
business day, depending upon the time of day the request is submitted.
Liquidity Guard: Liquidity Guard is an automated means where VAL prevents certain IOC and
Peg orders from interacting with resting Peg orders.  Stocks that are subject to the interaction
restrictions of Liquidity Guard are those that have a historical bid offer spread that is greater than
or equal to $0.03 per share or a trailing 21-day average daily volume that is less than or equal to
3 million shares.  Liquidity Guard uses inputs including a stock's trailing intraday bid offer
spread, historical bid offer spread, and volatility, to compute price bands where executions can
take place on a security basis.   If a potential match of an incoming IOC or Peg order against a
resting Peg order would occur at a price outside of the computed price bands for a particular
stock, then the IOC or Peg order would be blocked from interacting against the resting Peg order.
All Subscribers are subject to Liquidity Guard, but a Subscriber may elect to opt out of having
their Peg orders subject to Liquidity Guard. Subscribers can request to opt out of Liquidity Guard
through their sales person, who enter a ticket to make the request.  Thereafter, an entry is made
in a configuration file which takes effect in most cases on the next business day, but could take
effect either the same day or greater than the next business day, depending upon the time of day
the request is submitted.  Subscribers are not provided with any information on when Liquidity
Guard effected the interaction of their orders.  Liquidity Guard is not employed in Alert.
Self-Match Prevention: Subscribers may provide instructions that will prevent orders from
crossing if the resulting cross may result in a transaction with no change in beneficial ownership.
Subscribers can request Self-Match Prevention through their salesperson, who enter a ticket to
make the request.  Thereafter, an entry is made in a configuration file which takes effect in most
cases on the next business day, but could take effect either the same day or greater than the next
business day, depending upon the time of day the request is submitted.
Further, Subscribers are able to block interaction against certain Virtu MPIDs.  See the response
to Part II, Item 3b for further detail.
Alert:
Participant Type Blocking: Electronic Participants can request to block interaction against
Human Participants via a FIX tag, on an individual order basis.  Human Participants can request
to block interaction against Electronic Participants.  This blocking instruction is supported at the
session level.
Participant and Symbol Specific Blocking: Alert Sales and Coverage personnel can block certain
participants in whole or at a symbol level.  Alert Sales and Coverage personnel apply participant
blocks in whole, or at a symbol level, on an intraday basis if a participant is having a technical
issue. For example, if an Alert participant was duping messages repeatedly then the Alert Sales
and Coverage personnel could introduce a temporary block until the issue was resolved.  Alert
Sales and Coverage personnel can lift this block once the participant verifies the technical issue
has been resolved.  Symbol level blocks are also applied on an automated basis between an
Electronic Participant and a Human Participant, as well as between two Electronic Participants. If within a two-minute span, for a given symbol,
three consecutive invitations to Firm Up between the two participants result in no trades, a one
minute block will be applied between the two participants in the given symbol.  After the one-
minute blocking period, the block between the two participants will automatically be lifted in the
given symbol.   The three-minute time span begins at the time of when the first invitation is sent.
Symbol level blocks do not carry over into the next trading day.  Please see Part III, Item 9(a) for
more detail on the POSIT Alert Conditional Order process.
Self-Match Prevention: Subscribers may provide instructions that will prevent orders from
crossing if the resulting cross may result in a transaction with no change in beneficial ownership.</taPart3Item14aCntrPrtyDtls>

      <taPart3Item19aSrvcUsgFees>Some Subscribers do not have a dedicated rate for executions in POSIT, but, instead, have a
default rate across VAL's products where that default rate can apply to executions in POSIT. The
commissions charged to execute in POSIT can vary based on the means of access.  Direct
Subscribers not using other products are charged a rate per executed share ranging from $0.0005
to $0.0065.  Orders originating from Subscribers accessing POSIT through Alert, VAL's
algorithms, smart order router, trading desks, and/or Alert are charged a rate per executed share
based on the fees associated with the particular products used by the Subscriber, irrespective of
whether the orders are executed in POSIT or another venue.</taPart3Item19aSrvcUsgFees>
      <taPart3Item19bBundldSrvcUsgFees>VAL negotiates its commissions for use of its execution products and services, which could
include executions in POSIT, on a client-by-client (including Subscriber-by-Subscriber) basis.
VAL will consider a number of factors in determining the fee an individual client will be
assessed, including, but not limited to, the client's overall relationship with the Firm, the type of
trading flow, the amount of trading flow, and the markets that will be traded.</taPart3Item19bBundldSrvcUsgFees>
      <taPart3Item19cRbtDiscOfFees>VAL does not provide rebates or discounts.</taPart3Item19cRbtDiscOfFees>
      <taPart3Item20aSuspndProcdur>VAL has controls and systems in place to suspend trading on a symbol, Subscriber, or POSIT
basis.  As described below, these controls enable VAL to stop trading activity to meet regulatory
requirements and address any issues impacting the quality of executions within POSIT for,
among other reasons, approaching Regulation ATS Fair Access and Regulation SCI volume
thresholds.
POSIT honors trading halts and/or trading pauses that are announced pursuant to the Limit Up ?
Limit Down Plan and the Market Wide Circuit Breakers by automatically blocking trade
execution upon notice of a trading halt.  Specifically, during a regulatory halt for a security,
POSIT will (1) accept Day orders in the security, but not execute trades, and (2) accept IOC
orders in the security but immediately cancel them back to the Subscriber.  Subscribers have the
ability to cancel or modify day orders during a trading halt.  Furthermore, VAL retains discretion
to suspend trading in a given security at any time for any reason, and can accept, reject, or cancel
Subscriber orders.
POSIT will not execute orders if the NBBO is crossed.
POSIT will reject orders in certain NMS Stocks, including any symbols on POSIT's restricted
list or symbols for which POSIT seeks to remain below certain volume thresholds. In those
circumstances POSIT will provide clients with notice of the symbol(s) that will be
unavailable by posting information on the POSIT page on the Virtu Financial, Inc. website
(http://www.virtu.com).
With respect to the Agency Close Crossing Session, POSIT will reject orders if the security is
halted or paused at the time of submission. If cross cannot be consummated during the Agency
Close Crossing Session because a security is halted or the primary closing price for the security
is not published by the primary exchange for any reason, POSIT will cancel any indicative fills
and return the unfilled portion of the affected orders.</taPart3Item20aSuspndProcdur>

counterparty.  Broker-dealer Subscribers are required to be self-clearing or have an
arrangement with a clearing firm.  All transactions are submitted to NSCC for clearance and
settlement.  Subscribers may elect to clear their transactions via a Qualified Service
Representative (QSR) agreement or via an Automated Give-Up (AGU) agreement.    For
Subscribers that are Customers, VAL will settle their transactions through the facilities of the

      <taPart3Item23aMrktDatSrc>POSIT employs a proprietary market data system that uses direct market data feeds from
exchanges to determine the NBBO. POSIT utilizes this proprietary system to price, prioritize,
and match orders in the POSIT Continuous, POSIT Alert, and POSIT Agency Close Crossing
Sessions, in compliance with regulations, including Reg NMS and Reg SHO.

SIP data is used as a backup feed, and is used in place of a direct feed from a particular exchange
if that exchange is experiencing a technical issue.  Switching to the SIP data feed is done via an
automated process that compares direct feed data to SIP data.  Additionally, Core Operations
have the ability to switch to the SIP data feed on a discretionary basis.  Switching back to direct
feed data from the SIP data feed is done purely on a discretionary basis, and is performed by the
Core Operations team once this team has confirmed that direct feed data in question is correct.
The SIP data feed is also used for regulatory items, including limit up/limit down bands, trading
halts, and Reg SHO designations.

With respect to trades executed as a result of an Agency Close Crossing Session match, the
closing price for each security will be the closing price disseminated to POSIT from the primary
exchange data feed.</taPart3Item23aMrktDatSrc>
