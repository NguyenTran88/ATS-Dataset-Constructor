      <taStatementAboutAmendment>This Updating Amendment reflects changes to Part III Item 19 and to Exhibit 1.  The change to Part III Item 19 updates the high end of the range of basis point fees paid by certain Subscribers and updates the fact that these Subscribers may be either non-U.S. or U.S.-based Subscribers.  The change to Exhibit 1 reflects the election of a new Director to the Luminex Board of Directors and the replacement of the firm's Financial and Operations Principal.  These changes apply to all Subscribers and to the broker-dealer operator.</taStatementAboutAmendment>

Fidelity's asset management entity - Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company ("FMR Co.") - is a Subscriber to the Luminex ATS ( the "ATS" or the "System"). In that regard, FMR Co. enters trading interest and orders and executes transactions on the System and has no special access to or privileges in the System beyond what any other Luminex Subscriber can have.

        <taPart2Item5aProductsAndServices>The only such product or service that Luminex offers System Subscribers is a user interface (the "Luminex UI"). While virtually all System Subscribers use an external OMS, EMS, or order router to send orders and trading interest to the ATS, the Luminex UI is offered to all Subscribers. Subscribers can manage orders and trading interest via the Luminex UI and can also monitor executions in the ATS via the Luminex UI, even if those orders or trading interest were submitted to the ATS via an OMS, EMS, or router. While the Luminex UI is made available to all Luminex Subscribers, not all Luminex Subscribers use the Luminex UI. Orders and trading interest cannot be entered via the Luminex UI, and the use of the Luminex UI provides no speed advantage versus other means of order or trading interest management. Trade advertising (symbol only) from the previous trade date ("T-1") is made available to "opt-in" Subscribers via the Luminex UI on each trade date ("T"). Please see also Part II Item 7(b).  In addition, trade advertising (symbol only) from the current trade date (T) is made available to all Subscribers via the Luminex UI unless a Subscriber opts out of receiving such advertising.  Subscribers may contact Luminex Sales either via phone or electronically to opt out of this real-time advertising.</taPart2Item5aProductsAndServices>

Certain System Subscribers' traders, including but not limited to those of FMR Co., use FSB to route orders and trading interest to the System for handling and execution. As it does with other order entry systems, Luminex pays FSB a monthly fee for connectivity of the Subscribers and traders that use FSB to access the System. The Firm understands that FSB was not designed specifically for use with the System and can be used to reach other venues or trading destinations in addition to the System. Luminex is not a party to any agreements between Subscribers and FSB, and users of FSB are not treated any differently in the ATS than non-users of FSB.

        <taPart2Item6aUnitAfflEmployeeServices>FMR Sakura has no employees.  However, Luminex has a contract with a Fidelity-related entity - National Financial Services LLC ("NFS") - for a business unit of NFS - Fidelity Technology Group ("FTG") - to provide software support services to Luminex and the operations of the ATS as described more fully in Part III, Items 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20 and 21.  A limited number of FTG employees have access to confidential trading information as part of their duties to provide software support to the ATS as described in Part II Item 7(d).

Pursuant to a fully-disclosed clearing agreement between Luminex and NFS, NFS clears and settles all transactions executed on the System. Please see Part III Item 22. Additionally, NFS maintains a proprietary account on behalf of Luminex and provides Luminex order-routing and execution services. This account is solely used by Luminex to effect proprietary transactions in connection with bona fide errors and occasional and infrequent accommodations. All such proprietary transactions are effected on market centers other than the System.</taPart2Item6aUnitAfflEmployeeServices>

While the System is housed and operated on Luminex servers and equipment, the Firm has engaged eBX, pursuant to a services agreement that restricts eBX's use of information obtained in providing operational and technological support to Luminex and provides substantial procedures to ensure security of Subscriber information, to provide technology resources and personnel to manage the technology suite and implementation of system changes.  Data center facilities are leased from Equinix Inc. in Secaucus, NJ (NY4).  The Firm licenses a FIX engine from Itiviti Group AB (f/k/a CameronTec Group).  The FIX engine provides connectivity with Subscribers' order-originating systems and transformation of FIX messages to/from internal data structures.  The System receives market data from ICE Data Services (see also Part III Item 23 below), a vendor that handles market data feeds from various market data providers.

      <taPart2Item7aDescrOfSafeGaurdsAndProcedures>Luminex deems client-specific trading interest, order, and trade data to be "Confidential Trading Information" in the context of this question. Pursuant to SEC Rule 301(b)(10) and other regulatory requirements, Luminex has critical physical and logical access controls to reasonably ensure that access to Confidential Trading Information of Subscribers is appropriately restricted to only those who need such access to support the System. The controls and related restrictions apply both to Luminex employees and those of FTG and eBX that support the System (collectively, "System support staff"). With respect to physical access controls, Luminex offices are locked at all times and are inaccessible to the public at all times. Access to Luminex office space is permitted for Luminex employees, a limited number of FTG employees who support the System, and a limited number of building management, building security, and other related staff. Physical access is controlled via enabled swipe cards, which must be approved by the Luminex Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or an approved delegate. The Luminex CISO regularly reviews reports to determine who accessed Luminex space to ensure that the documented access to Luminex office space was limited to authorized individuals and also regularly reviews the list of persons authorized to have access to the Firm's office space in order to reasonably ensure that only appropriate persons have access to the Firm's office space. The data center that supports the System is also equipped with multiple levels of security in order to reasonably ensure that access is limited to appropriately authorized individuals. It is important to note that even though a person may have physical access to Luminex office space, access to Confidential Trading Information is strictly controlled through the processes described immediately below.

Luminex uses a privileged access system as an access control with respect to Luminex systems, applications, and accounts and any Confidential Trading Information contained therein. The privileged access system is managed on the Firm's behalf by its information security vendor, Fixnetix Ltd. ("Fixnetix"). Fixnetix enables and disables accounts for applicable System support staff solely based upon instruction from the Luminex CISO or approved delegate. In addition, even those granted access can only access the information needed to perform their specific job functions. Access and entitlements are generally assigned to particular access groups, and thus access to Confidential Trading Information is limited to those groups that perform support functions that require access to systems that may contain Subscriber Confidential Trading Information. Please see Part II Item 7(d). Those not in such groups do not have access to Confidential Trading Information. Luminex performs a semi-annual review of all System support staff with access to systems containing Confidential Trading Information to ensure that access to systems that may contain Subscriber Confidential Trading Information is strictly limited to only those System support staff who need it in order to perform their job functions. These controls over access to Confidential Trading Information are reviewed on an annual basis as part of the Firm's Service Organization Controls ("SOC") 1 attestation audit that is conducted by an independent service auditor in an effort to ensure that these safeguards are followed. Luminex has also engaged Fixnetix to perform regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing assessments as part of the Firm's efforts to appropriately safeguard client Confidential Trading Information. Among other protections, the Firm employs firewall and intrusion prevention and detection systems to further protect such Confidential Trading Information.

Luminex also utilizes several data loss prevention measures in an effort to reasonably ensure that Confidential Trading Information is not inappropriately taken from Luminex systems. These measures include the blocking of Luminex employee access to on-line file sharing sites (including, but not limited to, Dropbox and other similar sites) and the disabling of write capabilities of USB drives on Luminex PCs and laptops so that Confidential Trading Information may not be copied onto portable storage devices. The Luminex CISO may permit the temporary availability of a file sharing site to enable Luminex operations staff to provide a specific Subscriber with application-related files, after which the file sharing site is once again blocked from availability. The Firm blocks access to social media sites from web browsers on Firm PCs and laptops, and the Firm also blocks access to internet-based webmail programs. In addition, Luminex captures and monitors all employee electronic communications through Firm accounts to reasonably ensure that employees are not inappropriately transmitting Confidential Trading Information outside of the Firm via email, text message, or other means of Firm-provided electronic communication. Electronic communications via Firm accounts are regularly reviewed by Compliance and management to ensure compliance with Firm policies. Firm employees are regularly trained on appropriate treatment of Confidential Trading Information, and related policies and procedures are also contained in the Firm's Written Supervisory Procedures document, which is required to be read and attested to by all Firm employees twice annually. There are confidentiality provisions within the written support agreements between Luminex and eBX and NFS that require those eBX and NFS (FTG) employees, respectively, to safeguard any System information that they may have access to as part of supporting the System.

In addition, all System support staff are subject to trading restrictions to ensure that such persons' trading activities do not conflict with the interests of System Subscribers. Luminex does not have any individual or retail customer accounts, including employee accounts. As such, Luminex employee trading accounts must be opened and maintained at other broker-dealers, upon approval by the Luminex Chief Compliance Officer (CCO). Luminex employees are required to disclose to Compliance all outside brokerage accounts, and duplicate trade confirmations and account statements are required to be provided to Compliance for all Luminex employee-related accounts held outside the Firm. Except as described below, System support staff from Luminex and FTG with access to Confidential Trading Information are prohibited from purchasing any individual (non-ETF) NMS equity securities and options linked to individual NMS equity securities, regardless of whether there are pending or recent orders or trades in those securities in the System. (Trading of ETFs is permitted under the Firm's employee trading policy.) Sales of individual (non-ETF) NMS equity securities, for those System support staff from Luminex or FTG who had preexisting positions prior to joining the Firm or beginning to support the System, are permitted with the advance permission of the Luminex CCO. The Luminex CCO will review the intended sale transaction versus the System's current and recent order and trade activity in the particular security. If the security that the System support staff person wishes to sell is either currently active in the System or has recently traded in the System, approval for the proposed trade will be denied. There are exceptions to these prohibitions if the System support staff person's accounts are managed by an advisor (human or automated) that has full investment discretion while the System support staff person has none. Whether the account is managed by the employee or by an outside advisor, Luminex employees must still disclose such accounts to Compliance and provide duplicate copies of account statements and trade confirmations to Compliance. Luminex employees must also comply with other trading-related Firm policies such as, but not limited to, its Insider Trading policy. FTG employees that support Luminex and have access to Luminex Confidential Trading Information must comply with the Luminex employee trading restrictions, in addition to any trading policies of their employer. Luminex Compliance does not receive or review duplicate copies of account statements or trade confirmations with respect to FTG employee accounts, but Compliance by FTG employees with the Luminex trading policies is monitored by Fidelity Compliance in cooperation with the Luminex CCO.  System support staff from eBX are subject to and bound by eBX corporate policies that govern the handling of confidential information and policies that prohibit employees from placing trades based on nonpublic information.  Any trading activity by System support staff from eBX is reviewed by that firm's Chief Compliance Officer to reasonably ensure compliance with eBX policies.  In addition, duplicate trading confirmations and account statements from the eBX support staff who have access to System confidential trading information are provided to and reviewed by the Luminex CCO to reasonably ensure that any trading does not appear to be related to or based upon Luminex Confidential Trading Information.</taPart2Item7aDescrOfSafeGaurdsAndProcedures>
      <part2Item7bCanSubscriberConsentToDisclosure rbPart2Item7bCanSubscriberConsentToDisclosure="Y">
        <taPart2Item7bExplainHowAndConditions>While Subscribers are able to do so, Luminex is unaware of such consent being sought or given, aside from information provided to entities such as custody banks, prime brokers, or other entities related to clearance and settlement of transactions. Confidential Trading Information is kept confidential (meaning, in this specific case, not disclosed outside the Firm to anyone who is not otherwise supporting the System) up until the time the transaction is cleared and settled, which involves NFS, Luminex's clearing firm, and the other external parties referenced immediately above. For example, on trade date, a Subscriber will submit instructions electronically designating to which subaccount shares purchased or sold through the Subscriber's master trading account should be allocated, designating that specific share amounts from the block execution be settled in specific subaccounts (typically in the name of mutual funds or similar funds on whose behalf the Subscriber is purchasing or selling securities). Depending on the method of clearance and settlement, details of the share purchase or sale will be made available to NFS and to other entities involved in the clearance and settlement of the Subscriber's transaction. Please see Part III Item 22 below. Any other consents to the disclosure of its own Confidential Trading Information must be made in writing, including but not limited to email, to Luminex Sales or other appropriate Luminex employees.

On a next day basis (meaning, on the trade date after the previous trade date), Luminex informs "opt-in" Subscribers of the securities that traded in the System on the prior trading day. In this context, "opt-in" means a Subscriber who wishes to receive these notifications, which are displayed in the Luminex UI. In exchange for being able to view these notifications in the Luminex UI, an "opt-in" Subscriber must be willing to allow the securities that they traded in the System to be included in the notifications. For example, if two "opt-in" Subscribers matched and executed a trade in the System in security "XYZ," then XYZ would be listed in the trade advertisement that is displayed to "opt-in" Subscribers the following trading day. If an "opt-in" Subscriber matched and executed a trade in the System with a "non-opt-in" Subscriber in XYZ, then XYZ would not be listed in the trade advertisement that is displayed to "opt-in" Subscribers the following trading day, unless there was a separate transaction in that same security involving two "opt-in" Subscribers. The parties associated with any trade in the System are not identified in any of these trade advertisements, nor are the specific terms and conditions of any transaction. The trade advertisements solely list the securities that traded in the System, provided that both parties to the transaction or transactions in that security were "opt-in" Subscribers. "Opt-in" participation in the trade advertising program is at the broader Subscriber level and not at the trader level. This means that if a Subscriber opts in to trade advertisements, then no trades by any of its traders could be excluded from the trade advertisements if an "opt-in" Subscriber was on the other side of that transaction.  As noted in Part II, Item 5, trade advertising (symbol only) from the current trade date ("T") is made available to all Subscribers via the Luminex UI unless a Subscriber opts out of receiving such advertising.  Subscribers may contact Luminex Sales either via phone or electronically to opt out of this real-time advertising.  As with the next day trade advertising, for a symbol to be advertised via the real-time advertising on T, the System must have had an execution in that symbol on T between two opt-in Subscribers.  If a Subscriber opts out of receiving real-time trade advertising, then that Subscriber's trades are not included among those which may be subject to real-time trade advertising.</taPart2Item7bExplainHowAndConditions>
        <part2Item7cCanSubscriberWithdrawConsent rbPart2Item7cCanSubscriberWithdrawConsent="Y">
          <taPart2Item7cExplainHowAndConditions>To the extent that a Subscriber provides such consent, which as noted in Part II Item 7(b) above must be provided in writing, such consent could similarly be withdrawn, again in writing.</taPart2Item7cExplainHowAndConditions>
        </part2Item7cCanSubscriberWithdrawConsent>
      </part2Item7bCanSubscriberConsentToDisclosure>
      <taPart2Item7dSummaryOfRolesRespOfPersons>Access to Confidential Trading Information is limited to those persons who either operate or support the operations of the ATS or are responsible for its compliance with applicable rules. A limited number of persons that support the ATS or who provide trading support to System Subscribers have access to such information. In addition to the Luminex staff noted here, outside technology support personnel from FTG and eBX with server-level access or access to System-related databases may have access to Subscriber Confidential Trading Information. The roles and responsibilities of such persons include those who support the System's operations and support software development with respect to the System, in addition to the Luminex Operations desk that provides functional and operational support of the System to Subscribers. As described in Part II Item 7(a) above, access to systems, servers, and databases that may contain Confidential Trading Information is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that access is limited to only those who require such access to perform their jobs and is removed promptly when no longer needed. Luminex employees have access to certain real-time Subscriber information via an internal tool called the Sales Dashboard. As described below, the information available on the Sales Dashboard includes, on a pre-match basis, the Subscriber and trader who entered an order or trading interest into the System, the price (for limit orders) and size of such order, and the time the order was entered. For all Sales Dashboard users other than the Luminex Operations team, on a pre-match basis the tickers or stock symbols associated with live orders or trading interest in the System are masked in order to protect the confidential nature of such information. Other terms and conditions of the order or trading interest available on the Sales Dashboard include the entered Top Quantity, the entered MinQ and AutoEx, if applicable, whether the order or trading interest was to buy, to sell, or sell short, the market capitalization segment of the security (Large Cap, Mid Cap, or Small Cap), which sector the security belongs to (e.g., Healthcare, Utilities, etc.), and various System individual security and aggregate trading statistics. A significant amount of the information available in the Sales Dashboard is not Confidential Trading Information but is instead non-Subscriber-specific or non-security-specific System data. Once a match occurs in the System, the real symbol relating to that match becomes available in order to allow the Sales team to respond to trader inquiries with respect to the match, to contact traders who may have fallen down on a match (See Part III Item 13), and to provide similar post-match trader support functions. The Sales Dashboard also includes post-match information including the executed quantity and execution price for those matches that result in an execution in the System. The Luminex CCO has similar access to post-match Subscriber information in order to respond to regulatory inquiries as necessary. Other Luminex staff have access to the Sales Dashboard for the purpose of monitoring the overall activity in the System. As described in Part II Item 7(a) above, all Luminex employees and eBX and FTG staff that support the System are subject to appropriate confidentiality commitments and to restrictive employee trading policies in order to reasonably protect Subscriber Confidential Trading Information from potential misuse.</taPart2Item7dSummaryOfRolesRespOfPersons>

        <taPart3Item2bSummaryOfCndtns>Luminex admits as Subscribers large (generally $1 billion or more in Assets Under Management (AUM)) buy-side asset management institutions that trade NMS equity securities. The Firm does not admit as Subscribers entities that trade proprietarily, high frequency trading firms, as that term is commonly understood, or broker-dealers. In addition to the AUM guidelines, prospective Subscribers must comply with Firm and regulatory due diligence, and account documentation requirements before being approved as a Subscriber. These due diligence requirements generally include the satisfactory completion of a written Subscriber Agreement, the submission of a U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-9 or equivalent, completion of the Luminex Consent to Public Name Disclosure Form (whereby the Subscriber agrees to have its name included on the current list of Luminex Subscribers published on and accessible via the Firm's public website), written Subscriber requests on preferences for the receipt of paper account statements (if applicable), a written Prime Brokerage Clearance Services Agreement (if applicable), the satisfactory completion of an Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) review, and other customer identification requirements such as the receipt and review of the Subscriber's Form ADV (if applicable) and verification of other information of the Subscriber, such as its authorized contact persons and authorized traders. At its discretion, the Firm may, on a case by case basis, allow an entity to become a Subscriber with an AUM below the Firm's target if the Firm otherwise believes the Subscriber and its potential trading activity and behavior would be a good fit for the System and its current Subscribers. Examples of these factors may include, but are not limited to, entities that frequently trade NMS equity securities in block size and generally do not engage in short-term (such as intraday) trading in the same security.

Luminex also admits broker-dealers that submit orders relating to Transition Management services (the "Transition Management Brokers") provided to asset management entities that are similar to the Luminex client types described immediately above.  "Transition Management" generally refers to the process of an entity (such as a pension fund) "transitioning" from one investment manager to another, for example, which may require the liquidation of one portfolio of securities and the acquisition of another portfolio of securities.   These Transition Management Brokers must attest to Luminex upon becoming a Subscriber that any orders or trading interest entered into the System by the Transition Management Brokers represents orders or trading interest from Transition Management clients of those brokers and not from any other desk or business lines of those brokers.  With the exception of the Transition Management Brokers, Luminex does not admit any other broker-dealers as Subscribers.</taPart3Item2bSummaryOfCndtns>

        <taPart3Item3aExcludngSumryDtls>If a Subscriber's trading activities appear to be having a deleterious impact on the trading platform, that entity may be excluded from being able to interact in the System. An example of these activities includes, but is not limited to, repeated and prolonged (in the judgment of the Firm) patterns of declining to trade when presented with matching opportunities (referred to as falling down). Please see Part III Item 13. The Firm, in its sole discretion, can exclude any Subscriber from the ATS services if, for example, the Subscriber begins to engage in short-term (such as intraday) trading on the platform or if a Subscriber commences proprietary trading. A failure to meet financial or other due diligence requirements could also lead to a Subscriber being denied access to the ATS. A Subscriber may also be excluded from the ATS services if the Subscriber was accused of committing or was found to have committed regulatory violations that could pose regulatory or reputational risk to the Firm or to its other Subscribers, in the Firm's judgment. And if a Subscriber appears to be encountering financial difficulties (as evidenced by publicly available financial reports, via self-reporting by the Subscriber or via inquiry by the Firm, via a material drop in the Subscriber's AUM due to redemptions, or other factors as determined by the Firm), then that Subscriber may be excluded from the ATS services.

        <taPart3Item5cOthrMeansDtls>In addition to using an O/EMS to send orders or trading interest to the System, Subscribers may also use a third party technology provider as long as the orders or trading interest are sent to the System directly from the client, meaning they are institutional customer orders or trading interest where the third party system passes a client identifier for the underlying Subscriber and trader that sent the order or trading interest. The third party routers are accessed via a front-end at the Subscriber, and any orders or trading interest sent to Luminex via such third party routers are submitted to the System using either FIX 4.2 or 4.4 or are converted to FIX 4.2 by the Firm. Although the third party routers are routed directly into the low-latency FIX gateway, while orders or trading interest submitted by O/EMSs are subject to additional processing upon submission prior to being submitted to the matching engine, there is no material latency difference between the third party routers and other means of order and trading interest transmission via an OMS or EMS. As noted in Part III Item 7(a), time of order receipt is the third and least important factor in order priority, which lessens the importance of any routing latency difference that may exist between third party routers and other means of order and trading interest submission.  Luminex may integrate with other technology providers at any time at its discretion or at the request of its Subscribers. Subscribers wishing to route orders or trading interest to the System via any unsupported third party technology providers would have to work with Luminex and the new third party technology to ensure that the new provider would pass to the System a client identifier for the underlying Subscriber and trader that sent the order or trading interest.</taPart3Item5cOthrMeansDtls>

        <taPart3Item6eRducdSpeedMeansDtls>The typical trading activities of some Subscribers may involve the simultaneous entry of numerous (perhaps dozens or more) indications of trading interest ("Conditionals"). The entry of such a large number of active Conditionals at one time could prove cumbersome for a trader to manage. In order to more effectively manage their Conditionals, Subscribers are able to opt in to a feature through which Subscribers can define both a number of Conditionals that to them would qualify as a "basket" (the minimum is one Conditional and there is no maximum) and also define a "collection period" for their Conditionals to be held in the System (the minimum is one millisecond and there is no maximum) before either the Subscriber or the System releases the Conditionals for potential matching opportunities. Through this feature, which would have to be enabled by Luminex and programmed into the Subscriber's particular user interface/front end, if the number of Conditionals entered by the Subscriber during the Subscriber-defined collection period equals or exceeds the Subscriber-set number that would define a basket for that Subscriber, the Conditionals will pend and will require the Subscriber to manually release the Conditionals into the System. If the number of Conditionals entered by the Subscriber during that collection period is less than the number that would be a basket for that Subscriber, the Conditionals will automatically go into the System and will become "live" active Conditionals. In either case, the Conditionals will pend during the Subscriber-specified collection period before being either manually or automatically released into the System. This functionality applies to Conditionals only and not to Firm Orders or Negotiable Orders and has no impact on order or trading interest priority.</taPart3Item6eRducdSpeedMeansDtls>

      </part3Item6eRducdSpeedDetails>
      <taPart3Item7AOrdrTypExplain>Negotiable Order and Firm Order Types - In either a Negotiable Order or Firm Order context (see below), a Subscriber must designate an "auto-execution" quantity associated with each Negotiable or Firm Order entered into the System ("AutoEx Quantity"). The minimum AutoEx Quantity is the System minimum trade size of 5,000 shares. Additionally, a Subscriber may designate an optional negotiable quantity associated with each order ("Negotiable Quantity"). There is no minimum or maximum Negotiable Quantity. A "Negotiable Order" is an order that includes a Negotiable Quantity. A Negotiable Order's total size (the sum of its AutoEx Quantity and Negotiable Quantity) at any given time is its "Top Quantity." A "Firm Order" is any order with an AutoEx Quantity that equals the Top Quantity. For both Firm Orders and Negotiable Orders, Subscribers may specify a minimum quantity at which they are willing to trade ("MinQ") on an order-by-order basis, which must be equal or greater than 5,000 shares. For Firm and Negotiable Orders, MinQ specifies the minimum AutoEx Quantity with which a Subscriber will interact and does not allow for the aggregation of contra-side orders to satisfy an order's MinQ requirement. For example, an order with a MinQ of 21,000 shares would not interact with three 7,000 share Firm Orders. An order's MinQ cannot exceed the order's AutoEx Quantity. All unexecuted orders may be cancelled prior to matching (as discussed below) by timely submission to the System of cancellation instructions.

Conditionals - A "Conditional" is a representation of potential trading interest by a Subscriber in a particular security. Upon a match in the System, an invitation is sent to a Subscriber that entered a Conditional subject to a match for that Subscriber to "firm-up" the Conditional with a specific share amount at which the Subscriber would be willing to trade. Subscribers who enter Conditionals are presented with the opportunity to trade but not an obligation to do so, as such Subscribers may either actively decline the invitation or allow the invitation to "time out" following the end of the Negotiation Period as defined herein. The minimum trade size for Conditionals is also 5,000 shares, and there is no maximum quantity, although each order is bound by applicable pre-trade Market Access limits established by Luminex pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3-5 (the "Market Access Rule"). Such limits in this specific case include overall share size limits in relation to a security's average daily volume, total order notional size limits (meaning, the share volume of the order multiplied by the current price of the security), and the notional size of the order in relation to the Subscriber's overall gross notional limit set by the Firm for each Subscriber. There is no AutoEx for Conditionals, nor is there a Negotiable Quantity. Subscribers that enter a Conditional may also enter a MinQ, which specifies the minimum size of a contra-side order with which the Conditional would be willing to potentially trade. The MinQ for Conditionals must be greater than 5,000 shares. A Subscriber who enters a Conditional with a MinQ will not be presented with invitations to trade against contra-side orders with a Top Quantity that is less than the MinQ of the Conditional. If a Subscriber enters a MinQ on a Conditional and elects to firm-up (as explained below), the Subscriber must firm-up for at least the MinQ amount. Potential information leakage could occur if a Subscriber enters a Conditional with a very large MinQ to probe whether there is an equally large order or Conditional on the contra side to potentially match against. If that large Conditional matches a similarly sized contra side order or Conditional, the Subscriber entering the Conditional (as described below) could decline a match and thus learn of large trading interest by another Subscriber without having had to effect a transaction in the System. In order to reasonably prevent such information leakage, the System caps the maximum size for the MinQ for Negotiable and Firm Orders and Conditionals. The maximum MinQ is set at 25,000 shares. Any change to the maximum MinQ will be disclosed in writing to Subscribers in advance of such change. For a Conditional, the entire quantity entered by the Subscriber is conditional, which gives the Subscriber the option, but not the obligation, to trade following a match of eligible orders or trading interest and the receipt of an invitation to trade. As described more fully below, a Subscriber who enters a Conditional may still decline an invitation to trade even if the contra side order's Top Quantity exceeds the MinQ of the Conditional.

Order Types - All orders or trading interest entered into the System are pegged, for order matching purposes, to the midpoint of the national best bid or offer ("NBBO") with the reference price calculation excluding (i) any manual quotations that have crossed the market and (ii) the quotations of any automated trading center with respect to which the Firm has declared self-help. A Subscriber may designate a limit price for each order or Conditional. Orders and Conditionals may only have a time-in-force of Day. All orders are either executed in the System or cancelled; the System does not route orders or Conditionals to other market centers for execution. Orders and Conditionals may be modified while resting on the System via cancel/replace, but not during the Negotiation Period, as defined below. Order Priority - Assuming orders and trading interest are marketable, the System prioritizes orders and trading interest based on the following factors, in the following order: (1) AutoEx Quantity (for Firm and Negotiable Orders only), (2) Top Quantity and (3) time of order entry or entry of the trading interest. Orders or Conditionals that are subject to a cancel/replace lose their priority in the System, with the "replace" being treated as a new order or Conditional for prioritization purposes. The functionality for Subscribers' traders to enter Firm and Negotiable orders is enabled in all OMS/EMS or routers that are integrated with/connected to the System. The functionality for Conditionals has been made available to all Subscribers but not all Subscribers use the Conditional functionality. Please see also Part III Item 9.</taPart3Item7AOrdrTypExplain>

When there is a match of two orders pursuant to the processes described herein, the System will determine whether either side has elected to execute only in round lots. If either side has so elected, the System will take the lower common quantity (either Firm or Firm-Up/Size-Up quantity) and will round down to the nearest 100 share lot if necessary. Subscribers that have made the round lot election may continue to bid in whatever increments they choose, but the execution will be rounded down to the nearest round lot. Any Subscriber Leaves Handling instructions (meaning, instructions on how the System is to treat the unexecuted or "leaves" portion of the order) are unaffected.

The minimum trade size for a Conditionals is also 5,000 shares, and there is no maximum quantity, although each order is bound by applicable pre-trade limits established by Luminex pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3-5. There is no AutoEx for Conditionals, nor is there a Negotiable Quantity. Subscribers that enter a Conditional may also enter a MinQ, which specifies the minimum size of a contra-side order against which the Conditional could potentially trade. The MinQ for Conditionals must be greater than 5,000 shares. A Subscriber who enters a Conditional with a MinQ will not be presented with invitations to trade against contra-side orders with a Top Quantity that is less than the MinQ of the Conditional. If a Subscriber enters a MinQ on a Conditional and elects to "firm-up," the Subscriber must firm-up for at least the MinQ amount. Potential information leakage could occur if a Subscriber enters a Conditional with a very large MinQ to probe whether there is an equally large order on the contra side to potentially match against. If that large Conditional matches a similarly sized contra-side order, the Subscriber entering the Conditional (as described below) could decline a match and thus learn of large trading interest by another Subscriber without having had to effect a transaction in the System. In order to reasonably prevent such information leakage, the System caps the maximum order size for the MinQ for Negotiable and Firm Orders and Conditionals. The maximum MinQ is set at 25,000. Any change to the maximum MinQ will be disclosed in writing to Subscribers in advance of such change. For a Conditional, the entire quantity entered by the Subscriber is conditional, which gives the Subscriber the option, but not the obligation, to trade following a match of eligible orders or trading interest and the receipt of an invitation to trade. As described more fully below, a Subscriber who enters a Conditional may still decline an invitation to trade even if the contra-side order's Top Quantity exceeds the MinQ of the Conditional.

There are no differences in how Conditionals are entered versus Firm Orders or Negotiable Orders except for the requirement to enter an AutoEx quantity for a Firm or Negotiable order, which is not applicable to Conditionals. Conditionals may be submitted via the Subscriber's OMS or EMS (whether a vendor system or a proprietary OMS or EMS) or via a third party service providers router. Upon a match with a potential contra-side order (which could be Conditional, Firm Order, or Negotiable Order), an invitation to firm up the Conditional is sent to the Subscriber who entered the Conditional. The trader who entered the Conditional has the ability to either decline the opportunity to trade, to firm up the Conditional for some quantity limited to the Top Quantity entered with the Conditional, or allow the invitation to expire. To firm up following an invitation to trade, a trader specifies the amount of shares that the trader is willing to trade relating to that specific match. No additional terms or conditions are entered in a firm-up. In addition, no information about the potential contra-side order or trading interest is provided other than the fact that one exists. Potential order and trading interest interaction scenarios are described in the response to Part III Item 11(c) and examples are also outlined in the attachment relating to Part III Item 11(c). If the trader who entered the Conditional elects to firm up and trade, an execution will occur at a price determined by the System and at the lower of the two submitted quantities submitted by both sides to the match. Please see also Part III Item 7. Once firm-up invitations are sent to a trader following a match in the System, the trader has twenty (20) seconds to respond to the firm-up invitation, with the exception of end of day order interaction processes described in Part III Item 11(c).</taPart3Item9aMsgUsgDtls>

Assuming orders or trading interest are marketable, the System prioritizes orders and trading interest based on the following factors, in the following order: (1) AutoEx Quantity (for Firm and Negotiable Orders only), (2) Top Quantity, and (3) time of order entry.</taPart3Item11aStrucOfNmsStk>

      <taPart3Item11cRulsProcsOfNmsStk>Assuming orders or trading interest are marketable, the System prioritizes orders and trading interest based on the following factors, in the following order: (1) AutoEx Quantity (for Firm and Negotiable Orders only), (2) Top Quantity, and (3) time of order entry. There are no order type restrictions following a stoppage of trading in a security during regular trading hours.

Order Interaction - It is possible for any of the supported order or trading interest types - Firm and Negotiable Orders and Conditionals - to interact with each other, as described more fully in the attached chart. In the scenarios described in the chart, the actions of the buyer who enters a particular order or trading interest type with various characteristics are mapped against the seller who enters a particular order or trading interest type with various characteristics. The scenarios assume both sides are marketable and show what the result would be if the buyer and seller took particular actions. A helpful way to read the chart, for each scenario, is, "Assume the buyer entered an order or trading interest of this type, for this size, at this price, and matched against a seller who entered an order or trading interest of this type, for this size, and at this price. If the buyer and/or seller responded to the match in this way or these ways, here is the expected result." Where at least one side of a match is either a Conditional or a Negotiable Order, an invitation to trade is sent to that Subscriber (a "Firm-Up Request" or a "Size-Up Request," respectively). In the case of a Negotiable Order, the Subscriber is required to trade at least the Subscriber's entered AutoEx Quantity and may elect to trade some, all or none of its negotiable shares as represented in its entered Top Quantity. Note that "SSR" in the chart refers to short sale restriction. (Please see the Order Interaction during an Exchange Act Rule 201 Short Sale "Circuit Breaker" below.)

Auto Execution - Where there are two marketable orders in the same security on opposite sides, the orders will match. Firm Orders that match will execute immediately at the midpoint of the National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO) at the time of the match, with the execution size being the smaller of the two orders' AutoEx Quantities ("Auto Execution"). If a Firm Order matches with a Negotiable Order and the Firm Order's AutoEx Quantity is either equal to or less than the Negotiable Order's AutoEx Quantity, this match will also result in an Auto Execution at the smaller of the two orders' AutoEx Quantities. Firm and Negotiable Orders that match with either another Firm or Negotiable Order within six seconds of the close of trading will be subject to Auto Execution (i.e., execution for the smaller of the two orders' AutoEx Quantity). A Firm Order can match and execute against another Firm Order until 15:59:59.

Negotiation - Size-Ups and Firm-Ups - In the absence of an Auto Execution, orders can enter negotiation after matches that include either a Negotiable Order or a Conditional. Where both orders are Negotiable Orders, or where only one order is a Negotiable Order and a contra-side Firm Order's AutoEx Quantity is larger than the Negotiable Order's AutoEx Quantity, the System will send a Size-Up Request to one or both Subscriber(s) to size-up. Subscribers that enter Conditionals and receive a match are sent Firm-Up Requests. For matches that occur in the System up until 15:59:37, Subscribers that receive invitations to negotiate are given 20 seconds in which to determine whether, and for what quantity, to size-up or firm-up. The Subscriber(s) will be given the option to size-up to their Top Quantity, regardless of the contra-side's Top Quantity. A Negotiable Order's Size-Up Quantity equals that order's AutoEx Quantity and the number of shares, if any, of the order's Negotiable Quantity that the Subscriber elects to make available for execution in response to a Size-Up Request. A Conditional's Firm-Up Quantity equals the number of shares, if any, of the Conditional s Top Quantity that the Subscriber elects to make available for execution in response to a Firm-Up Request. As noted, where a Conditional has a MinQ, a Subscriber may not firm-up for an amount less than the Conditional's MinQ. Upon an invitation to size-up or firm-up, a trader solely enters a share quantity and no other terms or conditions. Once submitted, a Size-Up or Firm-Up Quantity cannot be modified or cancelled. During the Negotiation Period, which is the time period that a Subscriber has to determine whether to firm-up or size-up, the Subscriber's order cannot match with another order. Additionally, neither party may cancel or modify its order once the initial match has occurred and the parties are in negotiation. Any cancellation requests will pend or queue in the System and will be processed once the negotiation has concluded. Execution size is determined upon the earlier of (a) the last required Subscriber's election to size-up or firm-up, or (b) 20 seconds from the time of the initial match (i.e., the Negotiation Period for all trades other than at the very end of the trading day). The size of the execution will be (1) in the event only one Subscriber was asked to size-up or firm-up, the lesser of that order's Size-Up or Firm-Up Quantity and the AutoEx Quantity of the contra-side order and (2) in the event both Subscribers are asked to size-up or firm-up, the smaller of the Size-Up Quantity or Firm-Up Quantity elected. The Negotiable Order's AutoEx Quantity will be used in lieu of a Size-Up Quantity if the Subscriber does not respond to the Size-Up Request. Execution price will be based on a decaying weighted average of the midpoints of the NBBO (based upon the Securities Information Processor ("SIP") feed for such security) observed each second of the Negotiation Period, starting at the time of the initial match, plus the two seconds immediately thereafter, where each midpoint price receives half the weight of the prior midpoint price (the "Derived Price"). The Derived Price will be rounded to the nearest halfpenny, subject to any constraints associated with an order's terms and conditions. In the event the Derived Price is worse than a Subscriber's limit price (the Exceeded Limit Price), the match between a Firm Order or Negotiable Order and another Firm Order or Negotiable Order will be limited to the lesser of the two orders' AutoEx Quantities at the Exceeded Limit Price. If one party to a match had entered a Conditional, or if both parties to a match had entered a Conditional, then an execution would not occur in the System if either party's limit price would be breached by the Derived Price of a transaction. See Part III Item 8(e) above for Mixed Lot Processing.

Order Interaction during an Exchange Act Rule 201 Short Sale "Circuit Breaker" - When an Exchange declares a short sale "circuit breaker" pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 201, trading centers, with limited exceptions, are prohibited from executing short sales at a price that is equal to or below the national best bid. The "circuit breaker" restrictions generally remain in place on the day the "circuit breaker" is declared and for the entire following trading day. As noted, where both the seller and buyer have entered marketable Firm Orders and match, the System will immediately execute the transaction at the NBBO midpoint, as discussed herein. During a Rule 201 "circuit breaker," if the seller has entered a Firm Order, a Negotiable Order, or a Conditional to sell short that matches against a Negotiable Order or a Conditional, the System may execute that order if the Derived Price of the transaction following the Negotiation Period is determined to be above the national best bid, in conformance with SEC Rule 201. If the Derived Price is determined to be at or below the national best bid, there will be no execution. Similarly, in these scenarios, the System will also check the Derived Price against the seller's limit price (if any), and if the Derived Price would violate the seller's limit price, there will be no execution.

End of Session Order Interaction - The order interaction protocols described above apply until 15:59:37. Until this time, negotiations can last for up to twenty seconds, and executions occur approximately two seconds following the conclusion of the negotiation. Because the System requires approximately two seconds to effect trades following a negotiation, the System requires that all negotiations end by 15:59:57. Between 15:59:37 and 15:59:57, the System will permit Negotiation Periods of less than twenty seconds, the duration of which will be the maximum amount of time remaining in the trading day up to 15:59:57. The shortest permissible Negotiation Period during this window is three seconds. For example, if a match occurs at 15:59:40, negotiations may continue for up to seventeen seconds (i.e., the maximum amount of time remaining until 15:59:57). Similarly, if a match occurs at 15:59:50, negotiations may continue for up to seven seconds (i.e., the maximum amount of time remaining until 15:59:57). If a match occurs at 15:59:54, negotiations may continue for up to three seconds (i.e., the maximum amount of time remaining until 15:59:57). Orders may not enter into a negotiation after 15:59:54. As noted above, all Firm and Negotiable Orders matched with either a Firm or Negotiable Order during the last six seconds of trading will automatically execute at the lesser of the two orders' AutoEx Quantities. Conditionals that do not receive a match by 15:59:54 or that are received by the System after 15:59:54 cannot execute before the close of trading. The truncated Negotiation Periods near the close of trading allow Subscribers the opportunity to execute transactions that might not otherwise be possible if the System only permitted a Negotiation Period of twenty seconds. In the event of a shortened trading day, such as a holiday, the same protocols would apply during the last 23 seconds of the shortened trading day.

Multiple buyers and sellers are not permitted in the same execution, and thus allocation does not apply in this context. Luminex considers the results of its pricing calculation to be price improvement for both buyer and seller given that it is either the midpoint of the NBBO or at a price derived from a series of NBBO midpoints as described above.

Errors or Accommodations - In the event of a System error, such as an execution at a price based upon outdated or erroneous market data, Luminex would contact the Subscriber who may have been disadvantaged through the error to ask if the Subscriber wishes to have its execution priced at the corrected price as determined by the Firm using updated market data. If the Subscriber states, either orally or in writing, that it wishes to have the corrected execution price, Luminex would adjust the price on that Subscriber's execution, assuming the money difference in the Firm's Error account. If the disadvantaged Subscriber determines and notifies the Firm orally or in writing that it does not want the erroneous execution at all, even if adjusted to the correct price, and the contra-side to the execution did not want to bust the trade, then the Firm would assume the Subscriber position resulting from error and would trade out of that position outside of the ATS by sending an order to its clearing firm for handling and execution. The Firm does not execute any principal orders in the System. The Firm also may, in limited circumstances and in its sole discretion, grant accommodations to Subscribers due to unusual execution scenarios that impact a Subscriber but are not the result of a System error. For example, a Subscriber may receive an execution in the System in a mixed lot and may prefer an execution in a round lot. In such a case, if requested by a Subscriber orally or in writing, the Firm may elect to fill the remaining shares that would create a round lot execution for the Subscriber. The Firm would price those remaining shares at the same price as the mixed lot execution in the System, and the Firm would send an order to its clearing firm for handling and execution to cover the shares needed to fill the odd lot portion of the Subscriber order. The Firm maintains separate Error and Facilitation accounts for handling these respective scenarios.

        <taPart3Item13aSegProcdurDtls>Since implementation of Conditional functionality, Luminex has been educating Subscribers and their traders on its expectations regarding how traders should conduct their trading on the ATS (e.g., discouraging fall downs, which occur when a trader is presented with a match and either actively declines the opportunity to trade or allows the invitation to timeout without accepting the opportunity to trade). The Firm appreciates that there are legitimate reasons why a trader would fall down or decline the opportunity to trade when presented with a match on any venue. For example, the trader may have previously traded that same NMS stock on another venue and he or she may perhaps no longer be interested in buying or selling more of that stock. Or, perhaps the price of the security in question moved in a direction that makes purchasing or selling the security less optimal for the trader. However, repeated patterns of falling down in response to numerous trading invitations can cause frustration and negative experiences for those with the contra side of those matches. Thus, the Firm monitors and polices fall downs in order to try to keep fall downs to a minimum and thus improve the trading experience for all Subscribers.

In order to encourage the preferred manner of trading for which Luminex was designed and that its Subscribers expect, Luminex offers traders that have exhibited the most beneficial trading patterns (e.g., traders who consistently firm-up Conditionals or who enter Negotiable Orders or Firm Orders) the ability to avoid trading with traders that exhibit the least beneficial trading patterns (e.g., traders who frequently fall down when presented with matching opportunities). Luminex accomplishes this by tiering its Subscribers' traders based on those traders' individual trading activities. The Firm's analysis of traders' trading behaviors (as indicated by fall down rates for Conditionals and by the entry of Firm or Negotiable Orders) focuses on activity at the individual Trader ID level, as a Subscriber may have multiple traders each with separate access (and perhaps multiple access points) to the ATS under a distinct Trader ID.

The Firm's tiering system consists of three tiers: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Tier 1 consists of traders who firm up 66% or more of the time on potential matches presented to them. And because Firm Orders and Negotiable Orders each contain a committed portion of that order that will trade upon consummation of a match, with no option to decline to trade, each entered Firm Order or Negotiable Order is the equivalent of a firm-up on a Conditional for the purposes of assessing trader behavior in the pool because each of these order types represents a willingness to trade upon a match in the System. Tier 3 consists of traders who firm up less than 33% of the time on potential matches presented to them. Tier 2 consists of all other traders.

Traders in Tier 1 are able, at their election, to avoid potential matches with traders in Tier 3. Traders may make this election at any time, including when they are in Tier 2 or Tier 3. However, the election will only become effective once the trader achieves a Tier 1 status. Traders may reverse that election at any time by notifying the Firm, and Luminex will implement that change as soon as practicable. The Firm has provided notice to all Subscribers and traders of relevant details regarding the tiering program (e.g., the criteria used to determine and move between tiers) prior to the implementation of the tiering program and will continue to provide notice in advance of any changes to the tiering program. Subscribers and traders may elect to receive notice of any changes to the placement of a Subscriber's traders in a tier that would impact their matching opportunities.

Tier calculations are performed weekly as of the close of business each Friday (or Thursday, in the event of a Friday market holiday). The calculation is based upon a week's worth of matches, with a minimum of twenty matches. If there are fewer than twenty matches for the week, the Firm will look back for the last twenty matches in the last (rolling) three months (meaning, the three prior consecutive calendar months preceding that weeks analysis date). In the event there are not twenty matches in the last (rolling) three months, the Firm will evaluate as many matches as possible but no fewer than ten matches. Any trader with fewer than ten matches will be in Tier 2. Tier placements are effective on the first trading day of the following week (Mondays, unless a particular Monday is a market holiday, in which case the tier placements would be effective on the Tuesday after the analysis is conducted).

Tier 1 "Opt-In" traders will match with all traders except those in Tier 3. Tier 2 traders and "non-Opt-In" traders in Tier 1 will match with all traders. Tier 3 traders will match with all traders except the Tier 1 "Opt-In" traders.

For traders with more than one method of entering orders onto the System (e.g., third party OMS/EMS or third party service bureau - see Part III, Item 5), that trader's trading behavior on each method is judged independently of the other for tier calculation purposes. Thus, if Trader A's activity via an OMS qualified Trader A for Tier 1 status but Trader A's activity via a service bureau router was deemed to be of Tier 3 status, Trader A could "opt-in" to avoid matches with Tier 3 traders, but that election would only apply to the potential matches that resulted from Trader A's use of his or her OMS and not to any potential matches that resulted from Trader A's use of the service bureau router. Similarly, if Trader B was in Tier 1 and opted in to avoid matching against Tier 3 traders, that Trader B could be presented with potential matches against orders entered by Trader A's OMS but would not be presented with matches against orders entered by Trader A's service bureau router.

The Firm has no requirement that any trader or set percentage of traders be in any particular tier. Consequently, it is possible that if there are no traders exhibiting less beneficial trading practices, there would be no traders in Tier 3. All new traders will begin in Tier 2. While there is no "appeal" process with respect to a trader's tier placement, Luminex retains the right to assign a Subscriber's traders to a different tier if in the Firm's judgment that tier is more appropriate based on factors such as those traders' broader histories on the Luminex platform.</taPart3Item13aSegProcdurDtls>

 In addition, pursuant to the Firm's Tiering process as described in Part III Item 13(a), traders who have exhibited the most beneficial trading behavior in the ATS (those entering Firm Orders or Negotiable orders or firming up on Conditionals on 66% or more of matches during the measurement period) may elect not to match against those traders with the least beneficial trading behavior in the ATS (those firming up on less than 33% of matches during the measurement period as defined in Part III Item 13(a)). Subscribers and their traders may make these elections relating to the Transition Management order flow and the Tiering-related matching by notifying the Luminex Sales team either orally or in writing. Elections relating to Transition Management order flow will become effective on the day of election, if made before or during trading hours.  Elections relating to Transition Management order flow made after trading hours will become effective on the following trading day.  All elections relating to Tiering will become effective on the following trading day. Subscribers and their traders are only provided with their own tier placement and are not provided with the tier placement of any other Subscriber or other traders. The System is set up by default to prevent matches between orders of the same Subscriber. Subscribers can elect to change that default setting by notifying the Firm either orally or in writing, and that change would be effective on the following trading day.</taPart3Item14aCntrPrtyDtls>

When a marketable buy order and a marketable sell order match in the System, invitations are sent to both the buyer and seller to either firm-up or size-up their respective orders for Negotiable Orders and Conditionals, respectively. Upon a match, the fact that a contra side order in that specific NMS stock exists in the System is then made known to another Subscriber that is a party to the match, although the specific terms of the contra side order are not disclosed. No other information about the contra side order or trading interest is disclosed upon a match. If a transaction is effected in the System, each side will not know whether there is any remaining interest in the security in the System unless there is a subsequent match in that security involving either of the two parties. Similarly, if a Firm Order matches with another Firm Order, or if a Firm Order matches with a Negotiable Order or a Conditional, each side of the potential transaction will become aware that there is contra side trading interest in the System in that specific security.</taPart3Item15bSubscrBndDtls>

        <taPart3Item17aTrtmntDiffDtls>End of Session Order Interaction - The order interaction protocols described in Part III Items 10 and 11 above apply until 15:59:37. Until this time, negotiations can last for up to twenty seconds, and executions occur approximately two seconds following the conclusion of the negotiation. Because the System requires approximately two seconds to effect trades following a negotiation, the System requires that all negotiations end by 15:59:57. Between 15:59:37 and 15:59:57, the System will permit Negotiation Periods of less than twenty seconds, the duration of which will be the maximum amount of time remaining in the trading day up to 15:59:57. The shortest permissible Negotiation Period during this window is three seconds. For example, if a match occurs at 15:59:40, negotiations may continue for up to seventeen seconds (i.e., the maximum amount of time remaining until 15:59:57). Similarly, if a match occurs at 15:59:50, negotiations may continue for up to seven seconds (i.e., the maximum amount of time remaining until 15:59:57). If a match occurs at 15:59:54, negotiations may continue for up to three seconds (i.e., the maximum amount of time remaining until 15:59:57). Orders may not enter into a negotiation after 15:59:54. As noted above, all Firm and Negotiable Orders matched with either a Firm or Negotiable Order during the last six seconds of trading will automatically execute at the lesser of the two orders' AutoEx Quantities. Conditionals that do not receive a match by 15:59:54 or that are received by the System after 15:59:54 cannot execute before the close of trading. The truncated Negotiation Periods near the close of trading allow Subscribers the opportunity to execute transactions that might not otherwise be possible if the System only permitted a Negotiation Period of twenty seconds. In the event of a shortened trading day, such as a holiday, the same protocols would apply during the last 23 seconds of the shortened trading day.</taPart3Item17aTrtmntDiffDtls>

      <taPart3Item19aSrvcUsgFees>Luminex's base execution rate is 50 mills ($0.005) per executed share. In rare instances, Luminex may charge a higher rate for Subscribers whose connectivity fees that Luminex pays are higher than most other Subscribers. Similarly, in rare instances, Luminex may charge a lower rate for Subscribers whose connectivity fees that Luminex pays are lower than most other Subscribers. Nearly all active Subscribers (those who regularly submit orders or trading interest to the ATS) pay the base execution rate. The lowest rate for any Subscriber is 25 mills ($0.0025) per executed share. The highest rate for any Subscriber is 150 mills ($0.015) per executed share. Certain Subscribers pay commissions in "basis points," ranging from a low of one (1) basis point to a high of five (5) basis points. Each basis point equates to one hundredth of one percent of the notional value of the transaction. Depending on the provider, Luminex may "pass through" certain fees that it is charged by certain service bureau routers or OMS and EMS entities. These pass-through fees are fully disclosed to the applicable Subscribers and typically range from a high of 15 mills ($0.0015) to a low of zero mills per executed share. In certain instances, these vendors may charge Luminex more than 15 mills and thus a pass through fee charged to a Subscriber that uses that router, OMS, or EMS may exceed 15 mills.  In some cases, Subscribers may elect to pay a rate higher than the base execution rate, and they can also apply additional commission as part of a Commission Sharing Arrangement ("CSA") in conformance with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This amount above the base commission rate to be attributed to the CSA program is determined solely by the Subscriber, pursuant to a written agreement with Luminex.</taPart3Item19aSrvcUsgFees>

      <taPart3Item20aSuspndProcdur>In the event that the Firm determines that it does not have a reliable SIP feed for the pricing of orders in the System, the Firm will halt executions on the System until such time that it determines the System has access to a reliable SIP feed. Any open negotiations involving any order types will be cancelled, and any orders in the relevant securities will be cancelled and returned to the entering Subscriber. Such orders or trading interest would need to be re-entered by the Subscriber following the resumption of trading in the respective securities. Please see Part III Item 11. The System ceases executing orders at 4:00 p.m. or such earlier time designated by the New York Stock Exchange in the event of an early close. Additionally, the System may not accept orders or trading interest if there are system issues or market disruptions that warrant a cessation of trading. The System also halts trading pursuant to regulatory halts declared by U.S. national securities exchanges, FINRA, and, if applicable, the SEC.

As noted in Part II Item 6(b), the System's primary servers are located in the NY4 data center in Secaucus, NJ.  The System has intrasite redundancy on separate servers in NY4 in the event the System's primary servers become unavailable.  In the event that the primary and back-up servers become unavailable, the System will suspend trading and cease operations until such time as its servers resume normal functionality.

Pursuant to SEC Rule 301(b)(5), an ATS is required to comply with the Fair Access requirements of SEC Rule 301(b)(5)(ii) if the ATS achieves certain trading thresholds in any individual NMS stock during at least four of the preceding six calendar months. Although it is likely that Luminex would not be required to comply with those Fair Access requirements in any event in light of factors referenced in SEC Rule 301(b)(5)(iii), even if it met the four out of six months trading threshold, Luminex nevertheless will cease accepting orders or trading interest in any NMS stock for at least one calendar month and thus would not permit or facilitate any executions in any such stock for that time period in the event the ATS met the referenced trading thresholds in that stock in three of the preceding five months. Once this period of time elapses that would prevent Luminex from meeting the four out of six months trading threshold, Luminex will resume allowing orders or trading interest to be submitted to the ATS in that NMS stock and would permit executions in that NMS stock pursuant to the executions methodologies described herein.</taPart3Item20aSuspndProcdur>

All transactions executed on the System are cleared and settled via NSCC and DTC by NFS pursuant to a fully-disclosed clearing arrangement between Luminex and NFS. A Subscriber settles a transaction in the System against Luminex via its clearing firm (NFS) and not against the other Subscriber that is a party to the match. The identity of one party to a transaction in the System is never identified to the other side of that transaction in the System.

      <taPart3Item23aMrktDatSrc>The Firm receives the SIP market data feed from ICE Data Services, a vendor that handles market data feeds from various market data providers. The System uses the market data (NBBO and last sale price data) to provide pricing data to its Subscribers that use the Luminex UI as described above, and the System also uses the market data to determine the NBBO as it determines the execution price with respect to transactions on the System. In addition, the System also uses the market data to determine whether the resulting execution price is within or outside of the NBBO at the time of execution. As noted above, the System does not prioritize orders based on price, nor does it display orders or trading interest to parties inside or outside of the ATS. Price-related market data is also used to determine whether Subscriber limit orders are marketable and eligible for a potential match in the System.
