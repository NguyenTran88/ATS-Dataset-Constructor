        <taPart2Item6aUnitAfflEmployeeServices>Confidential trading information consists of data regarding open or partially open Firm/Conditional Orders in JPM-X ("real-time data") and data regarding fully or partially completed Firm/Conditional Orders in JPM-X, including executions and cancellations ("historical data"). Confidential trading information, however, does not include post-execution reporting under applicable reporting rules or regulations. Confidential trading information also does not include aggregated data resulting from the combination of the JPM-X historical data associated with a Subscriber's Firm/Conditional Order with data regarding other Firm/Conditional Orders of the Subscriber or other JPMS clients, whether or not such Firm/Conditional Orders were routed to JPM-X ("Aggregated Data"). Aggregated Data includes JPM-X historical data from only the prior trading day, including end of trading on trade date, or earlier. Aggregated Data can include any JPM-X historical data or some subset of JPM-X historical data. Aggregated Data sourced only from JPM-X historical data does not provide Subscriber-specific or symbol-specific information. Aggregated Data can be used (i) by JPMS to provide market color or trend analyses externally and/or to internal principal or agency trading desks or senior management (e.g., JPMS prepares, and makes available online, a monthly summary of JPM-X activity that includes aggregate statistics such as the average trade size for each order flow type described in response to Part III, Item 13(a)); (ii) by JPMS to advertise, report on, or enhance the quality of its execution or other services offered to clients (e.g., JPMS has included in marketing materials aggregate VWAP slippage statistics that incorporate execution data from JPM-X and other venues to which Subscribers' VWAP orders were routed); and (iii) by third parties so they can provide JPMS with analytics (regarding, e.g., its market share or other performance metrics on a client-by-client basis). Such data sets are sufficiently aggregated and/or anonymized that they protect the confidentiality of Subscribers' trading strategies and are not themselves confidential trading information. Moreover, the use of such data sets, depending on the context, may be subject to confidentiality restrictions under agreements with recipients of the data sets and/or JPMC policies and procedures.

No employee or contingent worker ("workforce member") of JPMS or its affiliates is dedicated solely to servicing the operations of JPM-X. Shared workforce members with some level of access to confidential trading information on JPM-X include those described below to the extent they have a need to know such information to perform their respective responsibilities in connection with (i) the operations and support of JPM-X; (ii) JPMS' risk management and compliance with applicable law in operating JPM-X; (iii) assisting clients, senior management, and business units that send orders to JPM-X; or (iv) developing or maintaining JPMS's infrastructure and applications, including those related to JPM-X. In particular, as detailed below, limited groups of workforce members have access to all real-time and historical data in JPM-X (1), and limited groups of workforce members have access to all historical data from JPM-X (2). Separately, there are groups that have access to real-time and/or historical data regarding subsets of orders and executions that occur in JPM-X to perform their respective responsibilities (3). Persons authorized to access confidential trading information are prohibited from using confidential trading information for purposes other than those described below.

(1) The following groups have access to all real-time and all historical data in JPM-X for the purposes described below:

a) Electronic Client Solutions ("ECS") Liquidity Product Specialists (workforce members of JPMS) responsible for the development and day-to-day operation of JPMS' smart order routing technology (the "SOR") and JPMS' alternative trading systems, including JPM-X, who can access the JPM-X order book, which includes all real-time and historical data.  This access allows ECS Liquidity Product Specialists to monitor the performance of JPM-X, prepare aggregated data sets as described above, detect any Subscriber behavior resulting in a materially negative impact to the operation of JPM-X or to other Subscribers or indicating a need to change a Subscriber's order flow type or tier assignment, work to resolve issues related to the foregoing that may arise, develop further product initiatives, and respond to client inquiries and regulatory requests; and

b) Personnel in technology groups (workforce members of JPMS) responsible for providing technical support or developing and maintaining applications, e.g., trading applications and other applications or services that support trading personnel described below, or infrastructure across JPMS, including the applications and infrastructure on which JPM-X relies, can access real-time and historical data regarding orders and executions that occur in JPM-X as necessary in the course of their work to provide support and develop and maintain the applications and infrastructure.

(2) The following groups have access to all historical data from JPM-X for the purposes described below:

a) Operations personnel (workforce members of JPMS affiliates worldwide) responsible for processing and providing operational support for transactions effected by JPMS and its affiliates, including trades in JPM-X, who can access historical data so they can monitor the post-trade processing of and provide operational support for transactions executed in JPM-X, including with respect to the clearance, settlement, and allocation of such transactions, and work to resolve any processing or other operational issues that may arise; and

b) Personnel in Conduct Compliance and Operational Risk, Business Control Management , and technology groups (workforce members of JPMS affiliates worldwide), who can access historical data so they can maintain (i) JPMS' and its affiliates' compliance with laws applicable to the operation of JPM-X, including through supervision, surveillance and the preparation of regulatory reports and responses to regulatory request; and (ii) related systems.

(3) The following groups have access to real-time and/or historical data regarding subsets of orders and executions that occur in JPM-X for the purposes described below:

b) ECS senior management (workforce members of JPMS and its affiliates worldwide) responsible for the ECS business, including the JPM-X offering and its operation, who can access real-time and historical data at a summary level (e.g., aggregated order quantities by client or symbol) so they can appropriately supervise and manage the ECS Liquidity Product Specialists, ECS Client Coverage, ECS Product, ECS Connectivity, and ECS Sales groups;

c) Personnel in the equities Analytics, Automation, and Optimization quantitative research groups, Electronic Trading quantitative research groups, and the Markets Business Intelligence Group (together, the "Equities Quantitative Research Groups") (workforce members of JPMS), who can access real-time and/or historical data regarding JPM-X activity occurring through the upstream systems or desks they support when necessary in the course of their work to provide support or develop and maintain applications and infrastructure (including, in the case of (i) the Electronic Trading quantitative research group, to, e.g., develop quantitative models employed by the applications and to analyze the performance of these applications and their underlying models; (ii) the Analytics, Automation, and Optimization quantitative research group to, e.g., maintain the applications that support trading personnel described below and the integrity of data used by such applications; and (iii) the Markets Business Intelligence Group to, e.g., provide senior management with aggregated trading analytics);

d) Personnel in Operations and Business Control Management (described in section 2 above), who can access real-time data on a limited basis in connection with their responsibilities described above;

e) Business unit sales and trading personnel who route Firm/Conditional Orders to the algorithms/SOR or JPM-X for execution (workforce members of JPMS and its affiliates worldwide), who can access real-time and historical data regarding orders and executions that occur in JPM-X regarding only that unit's or a subset of that unit's Firm/Conditional Orders so they can monitor such Firm/Conditional Orders, field inquiries regarding their orders, including those Firm/Conditional Orders routed to JPM-X, or provide technical support for related trading applications; and

f) Personnel in Model Risk Governance and Review (workforce members of JPMS and its affiliates worldwide) who can access historical data so they can perform model governance and model review functions, including conducting independent assessment and monitoring of the performance of Firm models that execute transactions in JPM-X.</taPart2Item6aUnitAfflEmployeeServices>

      <taPart2Item7aDescrOfSafeGaurdsAndProcedures>JPMS has established written safeguards and procedures that restrict (i) access to all real-time and historical data regarding Subscribers' JPM-X Firm/Conditional Order information to identified in categories 1 and 2 of the response to Part II, Item 6(a) above and (ii) the personal trading of such individuals with access to Subscriber confidential trading information identified in Part II, Item 6(a). JPMS also has adopted and implemented written oversight procedures intended to ensure that the above safeguards and procedures are followed. Access to Subscribers' confidential trading information is restricted as described below.

Systems with Real-Time and Historical Data. Real-time and historical data is accessible via a front-office graphical user interface ("GUI") and database, each of which can be used to view the status of, and generate reports regarding, Firm/Conditional Orders routed to JPM-X; order management systems used to route Firm/Conditional Orders to the algorithms/SOR or JPM-X; and the servers upon which the GUI, database, order management systems, algorithms/SOR, JPM-X matching engine run. The algorithms/SOR and JPM-X matching engine generate and access such data for the purpose of routing Firm/Conditional Orders and matching and executing Firm/Conditional Orders, respectively. Access to real-time and historical data regarding all orders and executions that occur in JPM-X through these systems is restricted, via permissioned electronic logins, to personnel described in category 1 in response to Part II, Item 6(a) above (for the reasons stated therein).  Access, through the above-referenced systems, to real-time and/or historical data regarding subsets of orders and executions that occur in JPM-X is restricted, via permissioned electronic logins, to personnel described in sub-parts (a) through (f) of category 3 of the response to Part II, Item 6(a) above (for the reasons stated therein).

Systems with Historical Data. In addition to the systems noted above, JPMS maintains systems that include only historical data, i.e., these systems do not include real-time data. These systems include a GUI used to view JPMS' transaction data; Middle Office systems for the post-trade processing of transactions; and the servers upon which these systems run. Access to these systems, through which all historical data is accessible, is restricted, via permissioned electronic logins, to the personnel described in category 2 in response to Part II, Item 6(a) above (for the purposes stated therein)

Policies and Procedures

The above restrictions are maintained in part through written procedures requiring the escalation and approval of requests to access JPM-X data and the periodic review of such access. Moreover, JPMC has adopted written policies and procedure (the "Personal Account Dealing Policy" or "PAD Policy") requiring (i) employees and contingent workers subject to the PA Policy ("PAD Workforce Members") to disclose accounts that can hold and transact in the purchase or sale of publicly traded securities and over which PAD Workforce Members or related persons can exercise discretion ("Covered Accounts") and review and certify annually as to the accuracy and completeness of all Covered Account details, (ii) JPMC to monitor transaction details for Covered Accounts, (iii) PAD Workforce Members to preclear purchases, sales, pledges, and gifts of publicly traded and privately held financial instruments, and (iv) managers to review trading requests to prevent the improper use of material non-public information or other confidential information, conflicts of interest, and other applicable trading restrictions. Written supervisory procedures applicable to the JPMS U.S. Equities Division (the "WSPs") require reviews, documented at least on a monthly basis, to make certain that (i) new employees receive training with respect to the PAD Policy, (ii) employees have obtained preclearance appropriately, (iii) trading subject to the PAD Policy has been appropriately monitored, and (iv) escalated personal trading violations have been followed up on appropriately.

JPMS' written procedures for limiting access to confidential trading information, pursuant to JPMS' obligations under Regulation ATS Rule 301(b)(10), include a section of the WSPs regarding JPMS' alternative trading systems. The section requires reviews, documented at least on a quarterly basis, (i) to verify the appropriateness of the access afforded to those described in response to Part II, Item 6 who are authorized to view JPM-X data via certain front office and transaction data processing systems and (ii) to approve, or verify the appropriate approval of, all new requests to access JPM-X order data via such systems.

In addition, JPMC policies and procedures require that confidential trading information be shared only on a "need to know basis (i.e., shared only with a person with a legitimate business need, in the normal exercise of the person's employment duties, for knowing or having access to the information) and prohibit the unauthorized or improper use of confidential information and/or the front-running of client orders. Only the workforce members identified in response to Part II, Item 6 are deemed by JPMS to have such a need to know Subscribers' confidential trading information.</taPart2Item7aDescrOfSafeGaurdsAndProcedures>

      <taPart3Item7AOrdrTypExplain>The following order types are eligible for execution in JPM-X:

--Non-Peg Limit Order -- an order to buy or sell at a specified fixed price or better;

--Primary Peg Order -- an order to buy or sell at the inside quotation of the National Best Bid or Offer ("NBBO") on the same side of the market, even as the NBBO changes (with or without a limit price);

--Midpoint Peg Order -- an order to buy or sell at the midpoint between the inside bid and the inside offer of the NBBO, even as the NBBO changes (with or without a limit price); and

--Market Peg Order -- an order to buy or sell at the inside quotation of the NBBO on the opposite side of the market, even as the NBBO changes (with or without a limit price).

Each of the above order types can have one of the following two time-in-force instructions:

--Immediate-or-Cancel ("IOC"), which is an instruction that the order be executed immediately with any portion of the order that cannot be executed immediately being cancelled; and

--Day, which is an instruction that the order rest in the book maintained by JPM-X (the "Order Book") until the order is executed, with any portion of the order that cannot be executed by the end of the trading day, or earlier in accordance with the time interval specified by the Subscriber or an algorithm selected by the Subscriber, being cancelled.

A blank time-in-force field is treated as a Day time-in-force instruction.

The above order types are available for use by Subscribers that access JPM-X directly or via the algorithms/SOR, irrespective of whether such access occurs through JISU.  JPM-X does not offer post-only order types, and none of the above order types is eligible for routing to other Trading Centers.  As described in response to Part III, Item 9, JPM-X accepts limit and pegged conditional order messages corresponding to the order types described above with a day (but not IOC) time-in-force instruction.

The above order types cannot be combined (i.e., an order cannot be more than one order type).  Subscribers that access JPM-X by routing to it or the SOR directly, and algorithms that access JPM-X via the SOR on behalf of Subscribers, can modify, replace, or cancel day orders routed to JPM-X.  The modification or replacement of a day order results in the entry of a replacement order with a new time stamp and lower priority in time than the original order, unless the modification is a reduction in the quantity of the order, in which case the replacement order has a new time stamp but the same priority in time that the original order had prior to its replacement.

JPM-X rejects (1) short sale exempt orders, (2) orders priced at or above $1.00 per share if priced in a sub-penny increment, (3) orders priced below $1.00 per share if priced in an increment of less than $.0001, (4) orders that exceed limits imposed by JPMS pursuant to its obligations under SEC Rule 15c3-5, and (5) beginning on October 30, 2023, any order types and/or orders with any time-in-force instructions other than those identified above (for example, non Peg Market orders and/or orders with a time-in-force instruction of "On the Open" ).

An order is ineligible for execution in JPM-X unless the price, minimum quantity, and counterparty preference instructions associated with the order, if any, are satisfied.  Accordingly, a partially executed order is cancelled if the leaves quantity is less than the minimum quantity instruction associated with the order.  An order also is ineligible for execution in JPM-X if the order is a firm-up order or an order committed to a conditional order message during a firm-up period, as described in response to Part III, Item 9.

Once JPM-X determines that an order is eligible for execution, it is crossed with other eligible order(s) on the opposite side of the market based on price/tier/time priority (e.g., at a given price level, Tier 1 orders have higher priority than Tier 2 orders, and at a given price level within the same tier, orders received earlier in time have higher priority than orders received later in time).  (As described in response to Part III, Item 11(c), as between firm orders and conditional order messages at the same price, firm orders always have priority over conditional order messages irrespective of their tier or when they were received by JPM-X.)  When two orders eligible for execution are crossed, they are executed at or within their effective limit prices, as described in response to Part III, Item 11(c).  Accordingly, a peg order is executed at its pegged price or better.  JPM-X does not execute a cross if the inside quotation of the NBBO is crossed (i.e., the inside bid exceeds the inside offer) or locked (i.e., the inside bid is equal to the inside offer).  In addition, JPM-X does not execute a cross in any NMS stock that is subject to a regulatory or trading halt (although, as described in response to Part III, Item 20, JPM-X will continue to accept Firm/Conditional Orders in such an NMS stock and instructions to modify, cancel, or replace Firm/Conditional Orders in that NMS stock using the priority logic described in response to Part III, Item 11(c)).

Although a change in the NBBO would not affect the relative priority of orders (including peg orders) that remain eligible for execution after the change, the change could affect whether an order with a price instruction associated with it (including a peg order) is eligible for execution and the execution price at which orders that remain eligible for execution (including peg orders) are crossed.</taPart3Item7AOrdrTypExplain>

        <taPart3Item9aMsgUsgDtls>JPMS offers Subscribers a process by which they can find potential contra-side trading interest in JPM-X (the "Conditional Order Process").

The Conditional Order Process makes use of two types of trading interest.  The first type of trading interest is a conditional order message, which describes the price, size, side, symbol, and minimum quantity attributes of the Subscriber's trading interest.  JPM-X accepts limit and pegged conditional order messages corresponding to the order types described in response to Part III, Item 7(a) with a day (but not IOC) time-in-force instruction.  Subscribers can transmit conditional order messages to JPM-X directly through a proprietary FIX messaging protocol or via the SOR.  JPMS trading algorithms also can transmit conditional order messages to JPM-X via the SOR on behalf of Subscribers.  Conditional order messages, unlike firm orders, are not executable upon receipt.

The second type of trading interest is a firm order resting in the Order Book that is eligible to be matched with conditional order messages (a "Resting Order").  A Subscriber's firm order resting in the Order Book is eligible to be matched with conditional order messages unless (i) it has an IOC time-in-force instruction or (ii) the Subscriber has opted out of participating in the Conditional Order Process.

When a Subscriber or JPMS trading algorithm on behalf of a Subscriber ("User 1" for purposes of this discussion) transmits a conditional order message to JPM-X, JPM-X looks for contra-side trading interests that are eligible to be matched with the conditional order message.  A contra-side trading interest can take the form of another conditional order message or a Resting Order transmitted by a Subscriber or JPMS trading algorithm on behalf of a Subscriber ("User 2" for purposes of this discussion).  JPM-X determines whether User 2's contra-side trading interest is eligible to be matched with User 1's conditional order message based on (i) the price, size, side, symbol, and minimum quantity attributes reflected in User 1's conditional order message and User 2's conditional order message or Resting Order and (ii) User 1's and User 2's respective counterparty preferences (see response to Part III, Item 14).  As with firm orders, JPM-X matches conditional order messages with contra-side trading interest on the basis of price/tier/time priority, as described in response to Part III, Item 11(c).  (As described in response to Part III, Item 11(c), as between firm orders and conditional order messages at the same price, firm orders always have priority over conditional order messages irrespective of their tier or when they were received by JPM-X.)

If JPM-X matches User 2's contra-side trading interest with User 1's conditional order message, JPM-X transmits to User 1 a message indicating that contra-side trading interest has been found (a "firm-up invitation"), describing the symbol, quantity, and price of the conditional order initially routed by User 1.  JPM-X transmits the firm-up invitation to User 1 (i) via a proprietary FIX messaging protocol if User 1 is a Subscriber that transmitted the conditional order message to JPM-X directly or (ii) via the SOR if User 1 is a Subscriber or JPMS trading algorithm that transmitted the conditional order message to JPM-X via the SOR.  JPM-X simultaneously transmits a firm-up invitation to User 2 describing the symbol, quantity, and price of the conditional order initially routed by User 2, in which case JPM-X transmits the firm-up invitation to User 2 (i) via a proprietary FIX messaging protocol if User 2 is a Subscriber that transmitted the conditional order message to JPM-X directly or (ii) via the SOR if User 2 is a Subscriber or JPMS trading algorithm that transmitted the conditional order message to JPM-X via the SOR.  JPM-X will not send a firm-up invitation to User 2 if User 2's contra-side trading interest is in the form of a Resting Order.

When JPM-X transmits a firm-up invitation to User 1, JPM-X cancels User 1's conditional order message, and User 2's contra-side trading interest is not eligible to trade for the duration of the firm-up period, which is the shorter of (i) the time it takes for JPM-X to match User 1's firm-up order, described below, with User 2's firm-up order or Resting Order and (ii) the default firm-up period, which is currently two seconds.

Upon receipt of the firm-up invitation, User 1 and, if applicable, User 2 have the option to (1) do nothing or (2) transmit a firm order in response to the firm-up invitation (a "firm-up order") within the default firm-up period to JPM-X.  The price, size, and minimum quantity attributes reflected in a Subscriber's firm-up order may differ from the corresponding attributes reflected in the Subscriber's earlier conditional order message.  If User 2's contra-side trading interest is in the form of a conditional order message and User 1 and User 2 transmit firm-up orders within the default firm-up period, JPM-X will cross the two firm-up orders based on their respective order attributes; if only one firm-up order is transmitted within the default firm-up period, JPM-X will cross the firm-up order with an available firm order resting in the Order Book, if any, consistent with the execution priorities described in response to Part III, Item 7(a).  If User 2's contra-side trading interest is in the form of a Resting Order and User 1 transmits a firm-up order within the default firm-up period, JPM-X will cross the firm-up order and Resting Order based on their respective order attributes; if the Resting Order has been cancelled, JPM-X will cross the firm-up order with an available firm order resting in the Order Book, if any, consistent with the execution priorities described in response to Part III, Item 7(a).  If JPM-X is unable to cross a firm-up order with another order or partially crosses a firm-up order with another order, JPM-X will cancel the unexecuted firm-up order or unexecuted portion of the firm-up order.

JPMS logs details regarding conditional order messages (including information regarding firm-up invitations sent, firm-up orders received, and execution quantities) within JPM-X system files that can be reviewed by ECS liquidity product specialists to assess whether Subscribers have engaged in systematic behavior resulting in a materially negative impact to the operation of JPM-X or to other Subscribers, as evidenced by, e.g., a low firm-up rate in response to firm-up invitations (see Part III, Item 3), and consequently should be permitted to continue to transmit conditional order messages.

By default, (i) JPMS trading algorithms can transmit conditional order messages to JPM-X via the SOR and (ii) firm orders resting in the Order Book are eligible to be matched with conditional order messages.  Subscribers can opt out of (i) the transmission of conditional order messages on their behalf and/or (ii) having their firm orders resting in the Order Book be matched with conditional order messages.  Subscribers can opt out in whole or in part (with respect to a subset of Firm/Conditional Orders or all order flow) by contacting their JPMS sales representatives.  JPMS implements such restrictions as soon as reasonably practicable.</taPart3Item9aMsgUsgDtls>

JPM-X begins crossing firm orders, and matching conditional order messages with contra-side trading interest, in an NMS stock after the stock has opened on its primary exchange and, in the case of a stoppage during regular trading hours, after trading has resumed.

JPM-X is a crossing system that matches non-displayed firm orders and conditional order messages.</taPart3Item11aStrucOfNmsStk>

      <taPart3Item11cRulsProcsOfNmsStk>JPM-X accepts non-peg limit, primary peg, midpoint peg, and market peg Firm/Conditional Orders unless they (i) are marked short sale exempt, (ii) are priced in a sub-penny increment if priced at or above $1.00 per share, (iii) are priced in an increment of less than $.0001 if priced below $1.00 per share, (iv) exceed limits imposed by JPMS pursuant to its obligations under SEC Rule 15c3-5, or (v) beginning on October 30, 2023, are any order types and/or orders with any time-in-force instructions other than those identified in the response to Part III, Item 7 above (for example, non Peg Market orders and/or orders with  a time-in-force instruction of "On the Open").

All Firm/Conditional Orders accepted by JPM-X (whether routed directly by a Subscriber or routed via the SOR by a Subscriber or JPMS trading algorithm on behalf of a Subscriber) -- other than firm-up orders and Resting Orders that are committed to a conditional order message during a firm-up period, as described in response to Part III, Item 9 -- are eligible for matching based on the liquidity available in the Order Book.  JPM-X matches Firm/Conditional Orders on opposite sides of the market in an NMS stock based on the price, size, and counterparty preference instructions associated with them.

Firm/Conditional Orders, once found eligible for crossing, are matched by JPM-X on the basis of price/tier/time priority, which means, e.g., that (i) at a given price level, orders in lower numbered tiers have priority over orders in higher numbered tiers and (ii) at a given price level within the same tier, orders received earlier in time have priority over orders received later in time.  Accordingly, of two equally priced orders, the one that is in the lower numbered tier will have priority over the one that is in the higher numbered tier regardless of the times at which the orders were received by JPM-X.  As between firm orders and conditional order messages at the same price, firm orders always have priority over conditional order messages irrespective of their tier or when they were received by JPM-X.

When crossing two orders matched for execution, JPM-X executes at or within their effective limit prices.  For marketable limit orders, the effective limit price is the NBBO inside offer for buy orders and the NBBO inside bid for sell orders.  For peg orders, the effective limit price is the better of the limit price specified on the order, if any, and the price defined by the peg instruction.  (For example, for a midpoint peg order with a limit price, the effective limit price is the better of the order's limit price and the NBBO midpoint.)  If the effective limit prices of two orders overlap, the orders will cross within, or at one of, the effective limit prices.  Note that JPM-X does not execute a cross if the inside quotation of the NBBO is crossed (i.e., the inside bid exceeds the inside offer) or locked (i.e., the inside bid is equal to the inside offer).  JPM-X also does not execute a cross in any NMS stock that is subject to a regulatory or trading halt.  In addition, when a circuit breaker has been triggered for an NMS stock under Rule 201 of Regulation SHO and JPM-X has matched a short sale order for execution, JPM-X will only execute at a price that is above the NBBO inside bid.

JPMS, at the request of a Subscriber or on JPMS' own initiative, may determine to review any transaction in JPM-X to assess whether it was adversely affected by a technical issue or "clearly erroneous" as defined by relevant regulators (e.g., under FINRA Rule 11891, "the terms of a transaction are 'clearly erroneous' when there is an obvious error in any term, such as price, number of shares, or other unit of trading, or identification of the security").  If JPMS determines that a transaction was adversely affected by a technical issue or clearly erroneous, whether or not as a result of JPMS or Subscriber error, JPMS, depending on the facts and circumstances, may work with the affected Subscriber(s) to resolve the error and may cancel (bust) the transaction or assume responsibility for one side of the transaction and work to cover the resulting position as soon as is practicable.  JPM-X also may suspend matching in the event of volatile market conditions (e.g., wide bid/offer spreads).

JPM-X time stamps orders upon receipt and executions at the time they occur and reports them in milliseconds in accordance with applicable FINRA Order Audit Trail System and trade reporting rules.  JPM-X determines queue positions based on new order receipt times with microsecond precision, except in the case of a reduction in the quantity of an order, in which case, the replacement order assumes the queue position of the original order.</taPart3Item11cRulsProcsOfNmsStk>

        <taPart3Item13aSegProcdurDtls>Subscriber Firm/Conditional Order flow is assigned to an
order flow type, each of which corresponds to a tier used
for purposes of determining priority (given JPM-X's use of
price/tier/time priority as described in response to Part
III, Item 11(c)). JPMS assigns a Subscriber's
Firm/Conditional Order flow to an order flow type based
upon an initial review of information received from the
Subscriber at onboarding. The order flow types and
corresponding tiers are provided below. For the avoidance
of doubt, "institutional investor client flow" does not
include "U.S.-registered broker-dealer client flow" (and
vice versa), and neither of them includes JPMS flow or JPMS
affiliates' flow. Fills resulting from JPMS principal
trading desk flow accessing JPM-X via the algorithms/SOR
(Order Flow Type P-1 in Tier 4) may be provided to JPMS
clients on a riskless principal basis.

Tier 1 (Order Flow Type I-1) -- Institutional investor
client flow and JPMS affiliates' flow accessing JPM-X via
the algorithms/SOR;

Tier 2 (Order Flow Type I-2) -- Institutional investor
client flow with direct access to JPM-X;

Tier 3 (Order Flow Type I-3) -- U.S.-registered broker-
dealer client flow (both agency and principal) accessing
JPM-X via the algorithms/SOR;

Tier 4 (Order Flow Type P-1) -- Internal (JPMS) principal
trading desk flow accessing JPM-X via the algorithms/SOR;

Tier 5 (Order Flow Type I-4 / ELP) -- Flow of external
broker-dealers categorized as electronic liquidity
providers with direct access to JPM-X; and

Tier 5 (Order Flow Type I-5) -- Flow of external broker-
dealers not categorized as electronic liquidity providers
(both agency and principal) with direct access to JPM-X.

There is no specific length of time that an order flow type
or tier assignment for a Subscriber will remain in effect;
however, JPMS conducts a quarterly review of the trading
activity in JPM-X of a sample set of Subscribers to confirm
the accuracy of   the Subscribers' order flow type and tier
assignments, and JPMS reserves the right to review and add,
remove, or revise an order flow type or tier assignment for
a Subscriber at any time. Based on a review of a
Subscriber's trading activity (including, e.g., discussions
with the Subscriber about changes in its business or
observed changes in order flow characteristics), ECS
Liquidity Product Specialists can request that the
Subscriber modify its order flow and/or trading behavior to
conform to its assigned order flow type or, if such a
modification seems unlikely, determine to amend the
Subscriber's order flow type assignment. JPMS would notify
the Subscriber in the event of a change in the order flow
type or tier assignment for the Subscriber. JPMS may change
an order flow type or tier assignment for a Subscriber as
described in response to Part III, Items 13-14 but does
not otherwise override such an assignment once made.

The segmentation of order flow described above affects
order interaction insofar as, in looking for matching
opportunities for a Subscriber's Firm/Conditional Orders,
JPM-X complies with the Subscriber's counterparty
preferences regarding the order  flow types or tiers with
which the Subscriber would like to interact, as described
in response to Part III, Item 14. In addition,
Firm/Conditional Orders, once found eligible for crossing,
are matched by JPM-X on the basis of price/tier/time
priority, which means, e.g., that at a given price level,
orders in lower numbered tiers have priority over orders in
higher numbered tiers, as described in response to Part
III, Item 11(c). Accordingly, of two equally priced orders,
the one that is in the lower numbered tier will have
priority over the one that is in the higher numbered tier
regardless of the times at which the orders were received
by JPM-X. As between firm orders and conditional order
messages at the same price, firm orders always have
priority over conditional order messages irrespective of
their tier or when they were received by JPM-X.</taPart3Item13aSegProcdurDtls>

ECS Liquidity Product Specialists may modify the Subscriber's configuration settings to the extent the restrictions relate to multiple orders.  JPMS may further limit the order flow types or tiers with which a Subscriber's Firm/Conditional Orders interact based on the Subscriber's trading objectives, consistent with the Subscriber's order instructions (e.g., when a Subscriber has informed JPMS that the Subscriber seeks a low participation rate and so JPMS, in light of that objective, reduces the liquidity available to the Subscriber in JPM-X by restricting the order flow tiers with which the Subscriber's Firm/Conditional Orders would interact).
