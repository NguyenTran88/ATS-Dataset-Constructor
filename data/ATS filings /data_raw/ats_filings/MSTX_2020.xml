There are no employees exclusively dedicated to ATS-6.<br>MS&amp;Co considers confidential trading information of ATS-6 to be (1) order-related information received by ATS-6; (2) execution-related information in ATS-6 (including identities of contra-parties to an execution); (3) conditional indication related information received by ATS-6; (4) firm-up request related information transmitted by ATS-6; and (5) data and analytics related solely to the activity of ATS-6 (with the exception of information made publicly available pursuant to reporting rules and regulations).<br>Listed below are the shared employees (which include employees and personnel such as consultants, temporary workers, and contingent workers of Morgan Stanley Services Group, Inc. (MSSG), an affiliated service entity that provides MS&amp;Co and affiliates with certain inter-company services including, infrastructure group support, information processing, communications and occupancy, and equipment) that service both ATS-6 and MS&amp;Co or an MS&amp;Co affiliate and have access to confidential trading information of ATS-6, along with the basis for such access.<br>- Information Technology and Operations employees:  Various technology groups of MSSG and MS&amp;Co are responsible for developing, monitoring, and testing and otherwise supporting various systems within MS&amp;Co's trading infrastructure.  Employees within these groups include developers, systems engineers, or network engineers for MS&amp;Co systems, including ATS-6.  They are responsible for reviewing and testing the coding, systems infrastructure, and network infrastructure that supports the MS&amp;Co trading infrastructure including ATS-6 to ensure stability and continued functionality and are also responsible for developing, testing, and implementing additional functionalities for ATS-6 as needed.  Certain of these technology-related employees have access to the real-time production environment for ATS-6.  As a result and in order to support the operation and infrastructure of ATS-6, these technology-related employees are able to access databases containing order-related, conditional indication-related, firm-up related, and execution-related information and other confidential trading information of ATS-6.  Similarly, certain Operations employees support the clearance and settlement of transactions effected through MS&amp;Co including transactions effected on ATS-6.  Those employees require access to confidential information of the Broker-Dealer Operator including confidential trading information of ATS-6, such as execution-related information and allocation information on order records, to assist in issues relating to clearance and settlement of such transactions.<br><br>- Sales and Trading employees:  Sales and trading employees, including account coverage, handle orders and conditional indications on behalf of clients.  This could involve providing trading discretion to determine when and how to handle an order or conditional indication, including routing an order or conditional indication directly or indirectly to ATS-6 among other market centers.  Account representatives assigned to clients whose orders or conditional indications may be entered in ATS-6 (among other market centers) have access, with respect to each applicable client, (i) to the order or conditional indication information prior to such information being entered into ATS-6, (ii) to the fact that such client's conditional indication or order received a firm-up request if applicable, and, (iii) as a result of servicing such client, to execution-related information, including the fact that such client's order or conditional indication was matched in ATS-6 with an order or conditional indication from another Participant in ATS-6.  Such sales and trading employees have access to their client information prior to entry and after execution in ATS-6.  Account representatives have system entitlements only for the clients they cover and only have visibility into where an order was ultimately routed and/or executed, whether to/in ATS-6 or any other market center.<br><br>- Risk Management personnel:  MS&amp;Co has employees that perform business unit risk management functions including market risk, non-market risk, credit risk, and technology risk with respect to the businesses of the Broker-Dealer Operator including ATS-6.  In performing these functions, these employees have access to order, conditional indication, and execution information and other confidential information relating to Morgan Stanley business activities, including confidential trading information of ATS-6, such as order-related information, conditional indication and/or firm-up related information, execution-related information, and client or desk trading activity.<br><br>- Supervisory and Oversight employees:  Employees acting in a supervisory or oversight capacity (including employees performing reviews at the direction of such employees) have access to confidential information relating to Morgan Stanley business activities, including confidential trading information of ATS-6.  Certain of these employees, among other responsibilities, have supervisory responsibilities reasonably designed to ensure that ATS-6 operates as intended.  They are also responsible for evaluating and reviewing Participant performance, assessing Participants and prospective Participants in connection with eligibility requirements (See Part III, Item 2(b)), reviewing market developments to adhere to regulatory obligations, and conducting analyses in connection with the foregoing.  In furtherance of these responsibilities, these employees have access to confidential trading information of ATS-6.<br><br>- Legal, Compliance and other Guardianship functions:  Employees in the Legal and Compliance Departments and others involved in complying with regulatory requirements support, with respect to such requirements, the businesses of MS&amp;Co, including the business of ATS-6.  These employees provide such support by, among other functions, responding to regulatory inquiries, conducting compliance and other reviews, performing internal audits of the trading infrastructure of the Broker-Dealer Operator (including the trading infrastructure supporting ATS-6), all with respect to activity within ATS-6.  In the course of performing such functions and generally providing support to ATS-6, those employees have access, on an as-needed basis, to confidential trading information of ATS-6, such as order-related information, conditional-indication and/or firm-up related information, and execution-related information in ATS-6.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

	            </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">MS&amp;Co maintains restrictions (including permissioned access) and policies and procedures designed to safeguard the confidential trading information of ATS-6.<br>Access to confidential trading information of ATS-6 is limited to the shared employees described in Part II, Item 6(a) (that is, information technology and operations employees; sales and trading employees; risk management employees; supervisory and oversight employees; and legal, compliance, and other with guardianship functions), to the systems that support ATS-6, and smart order routing technology of MS&amp;Co.  A description of applicable safeguards and oversight procedures is provided below.<br>-  Systems with Access to Order and Execution-Related Information:  The order and execution management systems used by the sales and trading employees (including account representatives) described in response to Part II, Item 6(a), can route orders and/or conditional indications to ATS-6, among other destinations.  Similarly, smart order routing technology and algorithmic trading products of MS&amp;Co can route orders and/or conditional indications to ATS-6 among other destinations.  These systems receive information regarding where such orders were routed and/or executed, which could be ATS-6 or could be any other market center.  These systems also receive firm-up requests which indicate that there is potential contra-side interest in ATS-6.  In addition, the smart order routing technology of the Broker-Dealer Operator has access on a continuous basis about open orders and conditional indications residing in ATS-6.  (See Part III, Item 9(a)).  MS&amp;Co maintains a database containing trading information of its NMS Stock ATSs.  Authorized employees (generally, authorized information technology and operations employees and certain authorized sales and trading employees, as needed, all as described in Part II, Item 6(a)) have access to the database in order to run queries and generate reports of trading activity within ATS-6.  Examples of such reports are volume reports, reports regarding firm-up rates, and order-to-fill ratio reports.<br>- Use of System Entitlements:  MS&amp;Co assigns permissioned logins to access ATS-6 and other aspects of MS&amp;Co's trading infrastructure.  These permissioned logins serve as controls to protect confidential trading information, including confidential trading information of ATS-6.  Relevant supervisors must approve all employee access to ATS-6 as well as other MS&amp;Co systems with access to order and execution information.  Access privileges are aligned to business function and designated reviewers evaluate access based upon the employee's current role.  Access is revoked when no longer required or upon an employee's termination.  An employee that previously had access to confidential trading information of ATS-6 will no longer have access to such information upon revocation.  Additionally, pursuant to written supervisory procedures governing access to MS&amp;Co NMS Stock ATSs, a supervisor conducts a quarterly review of access and entitlements relating to ATS-6.  This review is designed to confirm that those with access should continue to have access and also addresses whether any individual has transferred roles such that he or she should no longer require access.<br>- Application of Global Cyber Security Program:  Morgan Stanley's global cyber security program, including measures designed to detect and prevent unauthorized intrusions to Morgan Stanley systems, apply to MS&amp;Co's trading infrastructure, including ATS-6.<br>- Use of Information Barriers: MS&amp;Co maintains information barriers to separate employees and systems with access to confidential trading information of its NMS Stock ATSs from those not permitted to access such information.  These information barriers serve as controls to protect confidential trading information, including confidential trading information of ATS-6.  Morgan Stanley maintains a network firewall and customer gateways that surround its trading infrastructure, including ATS-6, for security purposes.  Subscribers (excluding Subscribers affiliated with the Broker-Dealer Operator) connect from outside that firewall and those customer gateways.  The firewall and customer gateways seek to protect access to confidential information of Morgan Stanley, including confidential trading information of ATS-6.<br>- Personal Trading Policy and Restrictions: MS&amp;Co prohibits all employees, including those with access to confidential trading information of ATS-6, from trading based on non-public or other confidential information, which would include confidential information of clients and, more specifically, confidential trading information in ATS-6.  Pursuant to the Morgan Stanley Global Employee Trading, Investing, and Outside Business Activities Policy and a supplement to that policy governing the Global Sales and Trading Divisions including the Institutional Equity Division of MS&amp;Co, employees (unless an exception is granted) must effect personal transactions in Employee Securities Account maintained at Morgan Stanley.  Further, the Morgan Stanley Global Employee Trading Policy requires employees to seek pre-approval for purchases and sales of securities (unless the Global Employee Trading Policy or applicable supplement provides an exemption for a specific type of security, such as an ETF).  In addition, employees generally must hold securities purchased in their Employee Securities Accounts for a minimum of 30 calendar days (or obtain pre-approval for such sale prior to 30 calendar days under exceptional circumstances.)  Employees are prohibited from effecting transactions that raise an actual or apparent conflict of interest with MS&amp;Co or its clients or in securities on Morgan Stanley's Restricted List.  Pursuant to applicable written policies and procedures, compliance and supervisory personnel, as applicable, review employee personal trading activity.  Such reviews are designed to confirm compliance with MS&amp;Co's policies regarding pre-approval, holding period, conflicts of interest (including trading based upon confidential trading information), and Restricted List compliance.<br>- Morgan Stanley Code of Conduct: Morgan Stanley requires all employees to be bound by and observe its Code of Conduct, including provisions that address the handling of client information and impose a duty of confidentiality.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

In addition, as indicated in the response to Part III, Item 21(a), where appropriate, matches between two internal business units or trading desks of the Broker-Dealer Operator or of an affiliate are treated as journal entries (internal movements of positions and monies), do not result in a change in beneficial ownership, and therefore are not trade reported.

The best bid and offer is used, in turn, to determine the midpoint price for execution in ATS-6.  ATS-6 also uses the SIP feed for regulatory purposes (e.g., to determine whether a market is open or closed; whether a security is subject to a trading halt; and whether short sale restrictions are in effect) and for backup purposes.  The Broker-Dealer Operator uses the SIP feed as a backup when there is an issue or the perception of an issue with a market's direct feed or with the Broker-Dealer Operator's ability to receive and process the data from such market's feed.  The Broker-Dealer Operator makes such determination on a market-by-market basis.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">
