        <taPart2Item6aUnitAfflEmployeeServices>Confidential trading information consists of data regarding open or partially open Firm/Conditional Orders in JPB-X ("real-time data") and data regarding fully or partially completed Firm/Conditional Orders in JPB-X, including executions and cancellations ("historical data").  Confidential trading information, however, does not include post-execution reporting under applicable reporting rules or regulations.  Confidential trading information also does not include aggregated data resulting from the combination of the JPB-X historical data associated with a Subscriber's Firm/Conditional Order with data regarding other Firm/Conditional Orders of the Subscriber or other JPMS clients, whether or not such Firm/Conditional Orders were routed to JPB-X ("Aggregated Data").  Aggregated Data includes JPB-X historical data from only the prior trading day, including end of trading on trade date, or earlier.  Aggregated Data can include any JPB-X historical data or some subset of JPB-X historical data. Aggregated Data sourced only from JPB-X historical data does not provide Subscriber-specific or symbol-specific information.  Aggregated Data can be used (i) by JPMS to provide market color or trend analyses externally and/or to internal principal or agency trading desks or senior management (e.g., JPMS has included in marketing materials aggregate statistics regarding JPB-X such as executed volume); (ii) by JPMS to advertise, report on, or enhance the quality of its execution or other services offered to clients (e.g., JPMS has included in marketing materials aggregate VWAP slippage statistics that incorporate execution data from JPB-X and other venues to which Subscribers' VWAP orders were routed); and (iii) by third parties so they can provide JPMS with analytics (regarding, e.g., its market share or other performance metrics on a client-by-client basis).  Such data sets are sufficiently aggregated and/or anonymized that they protect the confidentiality of Subscribers' trading strategies and are not themselves confidential trading information.  Moreover, the use of such data sets, depending on the context, may be subject to confidentiality restrictions under agreements with recipients of the data sets and/or JPMC policies and procedures.

No employee or contingent worker ("workforce member") of JPMS or its affiliates is dedicated solely to servicing the operations of JPB-X.  Shared workforce members with some level of access to confidential trading information on JPB-X include those described below to the extent they have a need to know such information to perform their respective responsibilities in connection with: (i) the operations and support of JPB-X; (ii) JPMS' risk management and compliance with applicable law in operating JPB-X; (iii) assisting clients, senior management, and business units that send orders to JPB-X; or (iv) developing or maintaining JPMS's infrastructure and applications, including those related to JPB-X. In particular, as detailed below, limited groups of workforce members have access to all real-time and historical data in JPB-X (1), and limited groups of workforce members have access to all historical data from JPB-X (2).Separately, there are groups that have access to real-time and/or historical data regarding subsets of orders and executions that occur in JPB-X to perform their respective responsibilities (3). Persons authorized to access confidential trading information are prohibited from using confidential trading information for purposes other than those described below.

(1) The following groups have access to all real-time and all historical data in JPB-X for the purposes described below:

This access allows ECS Liquidity Product Specialists to monitor the performance of JPB-X, prepare aggregated data sets as described above, detect any Subscriber behavior resulting in a materially negative impact to the operation of JPB-X or to other Subscribers or indicating a need to change a Subscriber's order flow type or tier assignment, work to resolve issues related to the foregoing that may arise, develop further product initiatives, and respond to client inquiries and regulatory requests; and

b) Personnel in technology groups (workforce members of JPMS) responsible for providing technical support or developing and maintaining applications, e.g., trading applications and other applications or services that support trading personnel described below, or infrastructure across JPMS, including the applications and infrastructure on which JPB-X relies, can access real-time and historical data regarding orders and executions that occur in JPB-X as necessary in the course of their work to provide support and develop and maintain the applications and infrastructure.

(2) The following groups have access to all historical data from JPB-X for the purposes described below:

a) Operations personnel (workforce members of JPMS affiliates worldwide) responsible for processing and providing operational support for transactions effected by JPMS and its affiliates, including trades in JPB-X, who can access historical data so they can monitor the post-trade processing of and provide operational support for transactions executed in JPB-X, including with respect to the clearance, settlement, and allocation of such transactions, and work to resolve any processing or other operational issues that may arise; and

b) Personnel in Compliance, Conduct and Operational Risk, Business Control Management , and technology groups (workforce members of JPMS affiliates worldwide), who can access historical data so they can maintain (i) JPMS' and its affiliates' compliance with laws applicable to the operation of JPB-X, including through supervision, surveillance and the preparation of regulatory reports and responses to regulatory request; and (ii) related systems.

(3) The following groups have access to real-time and/or historical data regarding subsets of orders and executions that occur in JPB-X for the purposes described below:

a) The ECS Client Coverage, ECS Product, ECS Connectivity, and ECS Sales groups (workforce members of JPMS and its affiliates worldwide), which provide client services to ECS clients, including JPB-X Subscribers, and can access real-time and historical data regarding subsets of orders and executions that occur in JPB-X so they can field inquiries from clients regarding orders routed to JPB-X by or on behalf of the clients;

b) ECS senior management (workforce members of JPMS and its affiliates worldwide) responsible for the ECS business, including the JPB-X offering and its operation, who can access real-time and historical data at a summary level (e.g., aggregated order quantities by client or symbol) so they can appropriately supervise and manage the ECS Liquidity Product Specialists, ECS Client Coverage, ECS Product, ECS Connectivity, and ECS Sales groups;

      <taPart2Item7aDescrOfSafeGaurdsAndProcedures>JPMS has established written safeguards and procedures that restrict (i) access to all real-time and historical data regarding Subscribers' JPB-X Firm/Conditional Order information to individuals identified in categories 1 and 2 of the response to Part II, Item 6(a) above and (ii) the personal trading of such individuals with access to Subscriber confidential trading information identified in Part II, Item 6(a). JPMS also has adopted and implemented written oversight procedures intended to ensure that the above safeguards and procedures are followed.  Access to Subscribers' confidential trading information is restricted as described below.

Systems with Real-Time and Historical Data.  Real-time and historical data is accessible via a front-office graphical user interface ("GUI") and database, each of which can be used to view the status of, and generate reports regarding, Firm/Conditional Orders routed to JPB-X; order management systems used to route firm orders to the algorithms/SOR; and the servers upon which the GUI, database, order management systems, algorithms/SOR, and JPB-X matching engine run.  The algorithms/SOR and JPB-X matching engine generate and access such data for the purpose of routing Firm/Conditional Orders and matching and executing Firm/Conditional Orders, respectively.  Access to real-time and historical data regarding all orders and executions that occur in JPB-X is restricted, via permissioned electronic logins, to personnel described in category 1 in response to Part II, Item 6(a) above (for the reasons stated therein). Access, through the above referenced systems to real-time and/or historical data regarding subsets of orders and executions that occur in JPB-X .

Systems with Historical Data. In addition to the systems noted above, JPMS maintains systems that include only historical data, i.e., these systems do not include real-time data. These systems include a GUI used to view JPMS' transaction data; Middle Office systems for the post-trade processing of transactions; and the servers upon which these systems run. Access to these systems, through which all historical data is accessible, is restricted, via permissioned electronic logins, to the personnel described in category 2 in response to Part II, Item 6(a) above (for the purposes stated therein).

Policies and Procedures

The above restrictions are maintained in part through written procedures requiring the escalation and approval of requests to access JPB-X data and the periodic review of such access.  Moreover, JPMC has adopted written policies and procedures (the "Personal Account Dealing Policy" or "PAD Policy") requiring (i) employees and contingent workers subject to the PAD Policy ("PAD Workforce Members") to disclose accounts that can hold and transact in the purchase or sale of publicly traded securities and over which PAD Workforce Members or related persons can exercise discretion ("Covered Accounts") and to review and certify annually as to the accuracy and completeness of all Covered Account details, (ii) JPMC to monitor transaction details for Covered Accounts, (iii) PAD Workforce Members to preclear purchases, sales, pledges, and gifts of publicly traded and privately held financial instruments, and (iv) managers to review trading requests to prevent the improper use of material non-public information or other confidential information, conflicts of interest, and other applicable trading restrictions.  Written supervisory procedures applicable to the JPMS U.S. Equities Division (the "WSPs") require reviews, documented at least on a monthly basis, to make certain that (i) new employees receive training with respect to the PAD Policy, (ii) employees have obtained preclearance appropriately, (iii) trading subject to the PAD Policy has been appropriately monitored, and (iv) escalated personal trading violations have been followed up on appropriately.

JPMS' written procedures for limiting access to confidential trading information, pursuant to JPMS' obligations under Regulation ATS Rule 301(b)(10), include a section of the WSPs regarding JPMS' alternative trading systems.  The section requires reviews, documented at least on a quarterly basis, (i) to verify the appropriateness of the access afforded to those described in response to Part II, Item 6 who are authorized to view JPB-X data via certain front office and transaction data processing systems and (ii) to approve, or verify the appropriate approval of, all new requests to access JPB-X order data via such systems.

In addition, JPMC policies and procedures require that confidential trading information be shared only on a "need to know" basis (i.e., shared only with a person with a legitimate business need, in the normal exercise of the person's employment or duties, for knowing or having access to the information) and prohibit the unauthorized or improper use of confidential information and/or the front-running of client orders.  Only the workforce members identified in response to Part II, Item 6 are deemed by JPMS to have such a need to know Subscribers' confidential trading information.</taPart2Item7aDescrOfSafeGaurdsAndProcedures>

      <taPart3Item4aHrsOfOperation>JPB-X operates during the regular trading hours set by the primary markets for NMS stocks; the hours for such a primary market typically are from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (New York time), Monday-Friday, except on holidays observed by the primary market. JPB-X can accept conditional orders from the algorithms/SOR starting at 6:30 a.m. JPB-X does not match or execute Firm/Conditional Orders in an NMS stock until after the NMS stock has opened on its primary market.

JPB-X accepts conditional orders designated for Close Price Match (see Part III, Item 7), and amendments and cancellations of such conditional orders, from the algorithms/SOR during the regular trading hours set by the primary exchange for the NMS stock being traded until the Close Price Match matching time. The Close Price Match matching time for an NMS stock is thirty seconds before the market-on-close cut-off time for that stock's primary exchange. JPB-X executes orders designated for Close Price Match after the primary exchange for the NMS stock being traded publishes an official closing price as determined by the closing auction.

      <taPart3Item7AOrdrTypExplain>Conditional and Firm Orders.  The algorithms/SOR and Subscribers that access JPB-X directly can route to JPB-X (i) conditional orders and (ii) if any of the conditional orders match with other conditional orders in JPB-X, firm orders routed in response to firm-up invitations received directly from JPB-X (in the case of the SOR with respect to orders designated for Close Price Match and in the case of Subscribers that access JPB-X directly) or from JPB-X via the SOR (in the case of JPMS algorithmic trading strategies).

Matching Types.  JPB-X accepts Firm/Conditional Orders designated for the following two matching types:

-- Volume-Weighted Average Price Match ("VWAP Price Match"), which matches orders, using the conditional order process described in Part III, Item 9, and crosses them at a VWAP price determined by JPB-X over the course of a pre-determined match period; and

-- Close Price Match, which matches orders, using the conditional order process described in Part III, Item 9, and crosses them at the security's official closing price as determined by the closing auction at the primary exchange for the security.

Firm/Conditional Orders designated for each matching type are maintained in separate order books within JPB-X and do not interact with each other.

Firm/Conditional Order Types.  JPB-X accepts (1) limit and market Firm/Conditional Orders for the VWAP Price Match matching type and (2) market-on-close Firm/Conditional Orders for the Close Price Match matching type.  A limit Firm/Conditional Order is a Firm/Conditional Order to buy or sell stock at a specific price or better.  A market Firm/Conditional Order is a Firm/Conditional Order to buy or sell stock at the best available price.  A market-on-close Firm/Conditional Order is a Firm/Conditional Order to buy or sell stock at its closing price as determined by the primary exchange for the stock.  JPB-X does not offer post-only Firm/Conditional Order types, and none of the above Firm/Conditional Order types is eligible for routing to other Trading Centers.  The above Firm/Conditional Order types cannot be combined (i.e., a Firm/Conditional Order cannot be more than one Firm/Conditional Order type).  A buy-minus Firm/ Conditional Order is treated as a buy Firm/Conditional Order, and a sell-plus Firm/ Conditional Order is treated as a sell Firm/ Conditional Order.

Time-In-Force Instructions.  For both VWAP Price Match and Close Price Match matching types, JPB-X only accepts a "day" time-in-force instruction.  A day Firm/Conditional Order is a Firm/Conditional Order intended to rest in an order book maintained by JPB-X until the Firm/Conditional Order is executed or cancelled at the end of the trading day or earlier.  A blank time-in-force field is treated as a "day" time-in-force instruction.

Modifications, Replacements, and Cancellations.  The algorithms/SOR and Subscribers that access JPB-X directly can modify, replace, or cancel day Firm/Conditional Orders routed to JPB-X, whether designated for VWAP Price Match or Close Price Match, as described below.  The modification or replacement of a day conditional order results in the entry of a replacement conditional order with a new time stamp and lower priority in time than the original conditional order, unless the modification is a reduction in the quantity of the conditional order, in which case the replacement conditional order has a new time stamp but the same priority in time that the original conditional order had prior to its replacement.  Note, however, that conditional orders designated for Close Price Match cannot be modified, replaced, or cancelled once the Close Price Match matching time is reached.  The algorithms/SOR and Subscribers that access JPB-X directly can cancel or reduce the quantity of a firm-up order prior to its execution.

Rejections.  JPB-X rejects (i) short sale exempt Firm/Conditional Orders, (2) short sale Firm/Conditional Orders designated for Close Price Match, (3) Firm/Conditional Orders priced at or above $1.00 per share if priced in a sub-penny increment, (4) Firm/Conditional Orders priced below $1.00 per share if priced in an increment of less than $.0001, (5) Firm/Conditional Orders that exceed limits imposed by JPMS pursuant to its obligations under SEC Rule 15c3-5 and (6)  any order type and/or orders with any time-in-force instructions not identified above (for example, pegged orders).

Eligibility for Matching and Execution.  A Firm/Conditional Order is ineligible for matching in JPB-X unless the price, minimum quantity, and counterparty preference instructions associated with the Firm/Conditional Order, if any, are satisfied.  Conditional orders, but not firm orders, can have minimum match size requirements.  As described in response to Part III, Item 9, when JPB-X sends a firm-up invitation, JPB-X cancels the corresponding conditional order, irrespective of the conditional order's minimum quantity instruction.  As also described in response to Part III, Item 9, a firm-up order is ineligible for execution in JPB-X during the order's applicable firm-up period.

Matching of VWAP Price Match Orders.  As described in response to Part III, Item 11, once JPB-X matches firm-up orders designated for VWAP Price Match and the match period has elapsed, the firm-up orders are crossed, at the VWAP determined by JPB-X.  In the event of (1) the cancellation of a firm-up order by the algorithms/SOR or a Subscriber that accesses JPB-X directly, (2) a response to a production issue, (3) the National Best Bid moving lower than or becoming equal to the limit of a matched sell order or the National Best Offer moving higher than or becoming equal to the limit of a matched buy order, (4) the triggering of a Rule 201 price test, or (5) the stock closing at the primary exchange, JPB-X will terminate the match period and issue partial fills before cancelling all matched firm-up orders.  The quantity of a matched order's fill will be proportional to the duration of the match period and the price of the fill will be the VWAP over the duration of the match period (or, if a Rule 201 price test is in effect, at a price that is allowed by the rule).  In addition, JPB-X does not execute a cross in any NMS stock that is subject to a regulatory or trading halt (a "Halt"), although, as described in response to Part III, Item 20, JPB-X will continue to accept Firm/Conditional Orders in such an NMS stock and instructions to modify, cancel, or replace Firm/Conditional Orders in that NMS stock using the priority logic described in response to Part III, Item 11(c).  Firm-up orders that were matched but for which the match period has not elapsed will be cancelled by JPB-X immediately after the Halt goes into effect.  If a Halt in an NMS stock occurs during regular trading hours while a firm-up period for one or more conditional orders in that security is underway, JPB-X rejects any firm-up order received during the firm-up period while the halt is in place.

Matching of Close Price Match Orders.  As described in response to Part III, Item 11, once JPB-X matches firm-up orders designated for Close Price Match in a NMS stock, they are crossed, based on time priority, at the closing price as determined by the closing auction and published by the primary exchange for the NMS stock after the exchange closes.  As described in response to Part III, Item 20, when a Halt is in effect for an NMS stock, JPB-X will continue to accept and match conditional orders designated for Close Price Match and to accept instructions to modify, cancel, or replace conditional orders in that NMS stock using the priority logic described in response to Part III, Item 11(c) but will not execute orders if the primary exchange does not publish a close price as determined by the closing auction for the stock, in which case JPB-X will cancel the unexecuted orders immediately after JPMS determines that the primary exchange has not published a close price as determined by the closing auction for the stock and has been delayed in doing so as a result of the Halt.  Firm-up orders that were matched but have not yet been executed will be cancelled by JPB-X immediately after the Halt goes into effect.

Changes in NBBO.  Although a change in the NBBO would not affect the relative priority of matched firm-up orders that remain eligible for execution after the change, the change could affect whether a firm-up order designated for VWAP Price Match with a price instruction associated with it is eligible for execution and the execution price at which orders that remain eligible for execution are crossed.</taPart3Item7AOrdrTypExplain>

        <taPart3Item9aMsgUsgDtls>JPB-X receives conditional orders routed to it by the SOR, by JPMS trading algorithms via the SOR, or by Subscribers that access JPB-X directly. A conditional order describes the price, size, side, symbol, and minimum match size of the trading interest. Conditional orders can take the form of the Firm/Conditional Order types described in response to Part III, Item 7. JPB-X matches conditional orders designated for the VWAP Price Match and Close Price Match as described in response to Part III, Item 11. If two or more conditional orders match (as applicable), JPB-X sends a firm-up invitation to (i) the SOR, if it had routed one of the matched conditional orders without instruction to do so from a JPMS algorithmic trading strategy, (ii) any JPMS algorithmic trading strategy that instructed the SOR to route one of the matched conditional orders, and/or (iii) any Subscriber that routed one of the matched conditional orders directly to JPB-X (with multiple firm-up invitations being sent to (a) any JPMS algorithmic trading strategy that routed more than one of the matched conditional orders or (b) the SOR if it had routed more than one of the matched conditional orders without instruction to do so from a JPMS algorithmic trading strategy). The firm-up invitation includes the symbol, quantity, and price of the associated same-side conditional order that prompted the firm-up invitation and the matched size of contra-side trading interest.

When JPB-X sends a firm-up invitation, JPB-X cancels the corresponding conditional order, and the recipient of the firm-up invitation (i.e., the SOR, a JPMS algorithmic trading strategy, or a Subscriber) has the duration of the firm-up period to determine whether to send a firm-up order in response to the firm-up invitation. The price and size attributes reflected in a Subscriber's firm-up order may differ from the corresponding attributes reflected in the Subscriber's earlier conditional order. The firm-up period is the shorter of (i) the time it takes for JPB-X to receive firm-up orders corresponding to the matched conditional orders or (ii) the default firm-up period, which is one second for both the Close Price Match and the VWAP Price Match. JPB-X does not match any firm-up orders until the firm-up period elapses. When the firm-up period elapses, JPB-X matches the firm-up orders designated for the VWAP Price Match and Close Price Match as described in response to Part III, Item 11.

By default, the algorithms/SOR can route conditional orders to JPB-X. Subscribers can opt out of the routing of conditional orders on their behalf. Subscribers can opt out in whole or in part (with respect to a subset of conditional orders or all conditional orders) by contacting their JPMS sales representatives. JPMS implements such restrictions as soon as reasonably practicable. In addition, JPMS reserves the right to limit or prohibit the use of conditional orders for Subscribers at JPMS' discretion if, as described in response to Part III, Item 3, ECS Liquidity Product Specialists responsible for the operation of JPB-X detect systematic behavior resulting in a materially negative impact to the operation of JPB-X or to other Subscribers as evidenced by, e.g., a high cancellation rate or, with respect to orders designated for VWAP Price Match, high VWAP slippage of the Subscriber's algorithmic orders.</taPart3Item9aMsgUsgDtls>

JPB-X begins matching conditional orders and crossing firm orders in an NMS stock after the stock has opened on its primary exchange and, in the case of a stoppage during regular trading hours, after trading has resumed.

      <taPart3Item11cRulsProcsOfNmsStk>JPB-X rejects (i) short sale exempt Firm/Conditional Orders, (2) short sale Firm/Conditional Orders designated for Close Price Match, (3) Firm/Conditional Orders priced at or above $1.00 per share if priced in a sub-penny increment, (4) Firm/Conditional Orders priced below $1.00 per share if priced in an increment of less than $.0001, (5) Firm/Conditional Orders that exceed limits imposed by JPMS pursuant to its obligations under SEC Rule 15c3-5, and (6) any order type and/or orders with any time-in-force instructions not identified in Part III, Item 7 above (for example, pegged orders).

A Firm/Conditional Order is ineligible for matching in JPB-X unless the price, minimum quantity, and counterparty preference instructions (see Part III, Items 13-14) associated with the Firm/Conditional Order, if any, are satisfied.  Conditional orders, but not firm orders, can have minimum match size requirements.  As described in response to Part III, Item 9, a firm-up order is ineligible for execution in JPB-X during the order's applicable firm-up period.

VWAP Price Match Rules and Procedures:

When two or more conditional orders designated for VWAP Price Match on opposite sides are eligible for matching in JPB-X, JPB-X matches them based on one-to-one random matching logic and sends firm-up invitations to the algorithms/SOR or Subscribers (as described in response to Part III, Item 9). Specifically, when assessing all eligible conditional orders able to be matched, JPB-X will, beginning with the side with fewer orders, randomly choose one conditional order on one side and one conditional order on the other side.  A conditional order routed by the algorithms/SOR or directly by a Subscriber can be cancelled by the algorithms/SOR or Subscriber, respectively, before the conditional order is matched.  Short sale conditional orders are not eligible for matching when a price test under Rule 201 of Regulation SHO is in effect.

Once the firm-up period described in Part III, Item 9 has elapsed, JPB-X matches the firm-up orders it received during the firm-up period (subject to the eligibility criteria for the firm-up orders discussed above and the firm-up orders' participation instructions). If either firm-up order quantity is less than the firm-up invitation quantity, JPB-X will match the firm-up orders (for the quantity that will satisfy the smaller firm-up order) at the end of the match period and cancel back any residual (see example below).  A pre-determined default match period commences upon the earlier of (i) JPB-X's receipt of firm-up orders corresponding to all firm-up invitations sent by JPB-X or (ii) the expiration of the firm-up period.  The default match period is currently five minutes for all firm-up orders.

As noted above, for the VWAP Price Match, JPB-X will commence the five minute match period with a match quantity that will satisfy the smaller firm-up order. For example,  JPB-X can match a Conditional Order to buy 1000 shares of ABC designated for the VWAP Price Match ("Order 1") with a Conditional Order to sell 500 shares of ABC designated for the VWAP Price Match ("Order 2") with a match quantity of 500 shares. If Order 1 firms up with 500 shares and Order 2 firms up with 300 shares, JPB-X will commence the five minute match period with a final match quantity of 300 shares. JPB-X will indicate the final match quantity of 300 shares on the firm-up order acknowledgement for Order 1 and Order 2 and will indicate the cancellation of 200 shares for Order 1 at the end of the match period.

During the match period, JPB-X monitors market data reported via the SIP (see Part III, Item 23) and any changes to parent order attributes.  Once the match period elapses, JPB-X crosses the matched firm-up orders at the VWAP (if one exists and it is within the matched orders' price limits, if any), determined by JPB-X based on executed trades reported via the SIP during the match period. Trade prices reported pursuant to the UTP Plan with the following sale conditions will be excluded when calculating the VWAP for the match period: Cash Sale, Price Variation Trade, Bunched Sold Trade, Sold Last, Market Center Official Close, Prior Reference Price, Market Center Official Open, Seller, Form T, Extended trading hours (Sold Out of Sequence), Contingent Trade, Average Price Trade, Sold (out of sequence), Derivatively priced, Qualified Contingent Trade (QCT). Trade prices reported pursuant to the CTA Plan with the following sale conditions will be excluded when calculating the VWAP for the match period: Average Price Trade, Cash Trade (Same Day Clearing), Price Variation Trade, Sold Last (Late Reporting), Market Center Official Close, Prior Reference Price, Market Center Official Open, Seller, Extended Hours Trade, Extended Hours Sold (Out of Sequence), Contingent Trade, Sold (Out of Sequence), Derivatively Priced, and Qualified Contingent Trade. If there are no eligible trades in the security during the match period for VWAP Price Match firm-up orders and therefore a VWAP cannot be determined, the matched firm-up orders are cancelled without a fill.

In the event of (1) the cancellation of a firm-up order by the algorithms/SOR or a Subscriber that accesses JPB-X directly, (2) a response to a production issue, (3) the National Best Bid moving lower than or becoming equal to the limit of a matched sell order or the National Best Offer moving higher than or becoming equal to the limit of a matched buy order, (4) the triggering of a Rule 201 price test, or (5) the stock closing at the primary exchange, JPB-X will terminate the match period and issue partial fills before cancelling all matched firm-up orders.  The quantity of a matched order's fill will be proportional to the duration of the match period and the price of the fill will be the VWAP over the duration of the match period (or, if a Rule 201 price test is in effect, at a price that is allowed by the rule).  For example, if the full match quantity is 5,000 shares over five minutes and one of the firm-up orders is cancelled two minutes after the match period began, JPB-X will end the match period and will execute 2,000 shares. The price of the fill will be the VWAP over the duration of the match period up until the time of cancellation of the matched firm-up order.

JPB-X does not execute a cross in any NMS stock that is subject to a Halt (although, as described in response to Part III, Item 20, JPB-X will continue to accept Firm/Conditional Orders in such an NMS stock and instructions to modify, cancel, or replace Firm/Conditional Orders in that NMS stock).  Firm-up orders that were matched but for which the match period has not elapsed are cancelled by JPB-X immediately after the Halt goes into effect.  If a Halt in an NMS stock occurs during regular trading hours while a firm-up period for one or more conditional orders in that security is underway, JPB-X rejects any firm-up order received during the firm-up period while the halt is in place.

Close Price Match Rules and Procedures:

A conditional order routed by the algorithms/SOR or directly by a Subscriber can be cancelled by the algorithms/SOR or Subscriber, respectively, before the Close Price Match matching time.

Following the Close Price Match matching time (see response to Part III, Item 4), JPB-X (i) matches conditional orders designated for Close Price Match on opposite sides that are eligible for matching in JPB-X based on time priority and (ii) sends firm-up invitations to the algorithms/SOR or Subscribers (as described in response to Part III, Item 9).  JPB-X does not accept conditional orders or amendments or cancellations of conditional orders after the Close Price Match matching time. JPB-X accepts firm-up orders and amendments to firm-up orders (to reduce quantity) after the Close Price Match matching time, during the firm-up period. JPB-X does not accept cancellations of firm-up orders designated for Close Price Match from the algorithms/SOR or Subscribers.

Once the firm-up period described in Part III, Item 9 has elapsed, JPB-X matches the firm-up orders designated for Close Price match received during the firm-up period (subject to the eligibility criteria for the firm-up orders discussed above and the firm-up orders' participation instructions) based on the time priority previously afforded the corresponding same-side conditional orders that preceded the firm-up orders, respectively.  Unmatched firm-up orders are cancelled back to the SOR or, for any unmatched firm-up orders routed directly by a Subscriber, the Subscriber.  Once the official closing price as determined by the closing auction is published by the primary exchange for the NMS stock, JPB-X crosses the matched firm-up orders at that closing price as reported by the SIP (see Part III, Item 23).  A Close Price Match firm-up order (a) will be cancelled if the primary exchange does not publish a close price as determined by the closing auction for the stock and (b) may not be executed fully or at all if it is partially or fully cancelled as a result of a response to a production issue.

As described in response to Part III, Item 20, when a Halt is in effect for an NMS stock, JPB-X will continue to accept and match conditional orders designated for Close Price Match and to accept instructions to modify, cancel, or replace conditional orders in that NMS stock using the priority logic described in this response but will not execute orders if the primary exchange does not publish a close price as determined by the closing auction for the stock, in which case JPB-X will cancel the unexecuted orders immediately after JPMS determines that the primary exchange has not published a close price as determined by the closing auction for the stock and has been delayed in doing so as a result of the Halt.  Firm-up orders that were matched but have not yet been executed will be cancelled by JPB-X immediately after the Halt goes into effect.

Additional Rules and Procedures for JPB-X Generally:

JPMS, at the request of a Subscriber or on JPMS' own initiative, may determine to review any transaction in JPB-X to assess whether it was adversely affected by a technical issue or "clearly erroneous" as defined by relevant regulators (e.g., under FINRA Rule 11891, "the terms of a transaction are 'clearly erroneous' when there is an obvious error in any term, such as price, number of shares, or other unit of trading, or identification of the security").  If JPMS determines that a transaction was adversely affected by a technical issue or clearly erroneous, whether or not as a result of JPMS or Subscriber error, JPMS, depending on the facts and circumstances, may work with the affected Subscriber(s) to resolve the error and may cancel (bust) the transaction or assume responsibility for one side of the transaction and work to cover the resulting position as soon as is practicable.  JPB-X also may suspend matching in the event of volatile market conditions (e.g., wide bid/offer spreads).

JPB-X time stamps orders upon receipt and executions at the time they occur and reports them in milliseconds in accordance with applicable FINRA Consolidated Audit Trail System and trade reporting rules.  JPB-X determines queue positions based on new order receipt times with microsecond precision, except in the case of a reduction in the quantity of an order, in which case, the replacement order assumes the queue position of the original order.</taPart3Item11cRulsProcsOfNmsStk>

        <taPart3Item13aSegProcdurDtls>Subscriber Firm/Conditional Order flow is assigned to an order flow type, each of which corresponds to a tier.  JPMS assigns a Subscriber's Firm/Conditional Order flow to an order flow type based upon an initial review of information received from the Subscriber at onboarding.  The order flow types and corresponding tiers are provided below.  For the avoidance of doubt, "institutional investor client flow" does not include "U.S.-registered broker-dealer client flow" (and vice versa), and neither of them includes JPMS flow or JPMS affiliates' flow.  Fills resulting from JPMS principal trading desk flow accessing JPB-X via the algorithms/SOR (Order Flow Type P-1 in Tier 4) may be provided to JPMS clients on a riskless principal basis.  (Unlike JPM-X, another NMS Stock ATS operated by JPMS, JPB-X does not have a Tier 5.)

Tier 1 (Order Flow Type I-1) -- Institutional investor client flow and JPMS affiliates' flow accessing JPB-X via the algorithms/SOR;

Tier 2 (Order Flow Type I-2) -- Institutional investor client flow with direct access to JPB-X;

Tier 3 (Order Flow Type I-3) -- U.S.-registered broker-dealer client flow (both agency and principal) accessing JPB-X via the algorithms/SOR; and

Tier 4 (Order Flow Type P-1) -- Internal (JPMS) principal trading desk flow accessing JPB-X via the algorithms/SOR.

There is no specific length of time that an order flow type or tier assignment for a Subscriber will remain in effect; however, JPMS conducts a quarterly review of the trading activity in JPB-X of a sample set of Subscribers to confirm the accuracy of the Subscribers' order flow type and tier assignments, and JPMS reserves the right to review and add, remove, or revise an order flow type or tier assignment for a Subscriber at any time.  JPMS would notify the Subscriber in the event of a change in the order flow type or tier assignment for the Subscriber.  JPMS may change an order flow type or tier assignment for a Subscriber as described in response to Part III, Items 13-14 but does not otherwise override such an assignment once made.

The segmentation of order flow described above affects order interaction insofar as, in looking for matching opportunities for a Subscriber's Firm/Conditional Orders, JPB-X complies with the Subscriber's counterparty preferences regarding the order flow types or tiers with which the Subscriber would like to interact, as described in response to Part III, Item 14.</taPart3Item13aSegProcdurDtls>

ECS Liquidity Product Specialists may modify the Subscriber's configuration settings to the extent the restrictions relate to multiple orders.  JPMS may further limit the order flow types or tiers with which a Subscriber's Firm/Conditional Orders interact based on the Subscriber's trading objectives, consistent with the Subscriber's order instructions (e.g., when a Subscriber has informed JPMS that the Subscriber seeks a low participation rate and so JPMS, in light of that objective, reduces the liquidity available to the Subscriber in JPB-X by restricting the order flow tiers with which the Subscriber's Firm/Conditional Orders would interact).

Accordingly, when JPMS algorithmic trading strategies route conditional orders to JPB-X via the SOR, any resulting firm-up invitations are sent by JPB-X to a JPMS algorithmic trading strategy via the SOR, and when the SOR routes conditional orders to JPB-X without instruction to do so from a JPMS algorithmic trading strategy, any resulting firm-up invitations are sent by JPB-X to the SOR.  A firm-up invitation includes the symbol, quantity, and price of the associated same-side conditional order that prompted the firm-up invitation and the matched size of contra-side trading interest.

JPMS also may suspend trading in an NMS stock if, e.g., (i) JPMS is unable to report trades in that stock as described in response to Part III, Item 21 or (ii) the market data received by JPB-X for the stock from the Securities Information Processors (discussed in response to Part III, Item 23) is unavailable, unstable, experiencing unacceptable latencies, or detected to be providing quotes that appear to have quality issues.

In the event of a technical system outage at JPB-X, the JPMS Electronic Trading Technology Production Management team can in its discretion:
-- Disable routing from the algorithms/SOR to JPB-X;
-- Disable the acceptance of orders in JPB-X; and
-- Cease the matching process in JPB-X by cancelling any open Firm/Conditional Orders.

If an NMS stock is subject to a Halt, JPB-X will handle Firm/Conditional Orders as follows, depending on the order type:

-- VWAP Price Match: When a Halt is in effect for an NMS stock, JPB-X will continue to accept Firm/Conditional Orders in that NMS stock designated for VWAP Price Match and instructions to modify, cancel, or replace Firm/Conditional Orders in that NMS stock using the priority logic described in response to Part III, Item 11(c), but JPB-X will not match or execute Firm/Conditional Orders in that NMS stock.  JPB-X will reject a firm-up order if a Halt occurred during the firm-up period for that order.  Firm-up orders that were matched but for which the match period has not elapsed will be cancelled by JPB-X immediately after the Halt goes into effect.

-- Close Price Match: When a Halt is in effect for an NMS stock, JPB-X will continue to accept and match conditional orders designated for Close Price Match and to accept instructions to modify, cancel, or replace conditional orders in that NMS stock using the priority logic described in response to Part III, Item 11(c) but will not execute orders if the primary exchange does not publish a close price as determined by the closing auction for the stock, in which case JPB-X will cancel the unexecuted orders immediately after JPMS determines that the primary exchange has not published a close price as determined by the closing auction for the stock and has been delayed in doing so as a result of the Halt.  Firm-up orders that were matched but have not yet been executed will be cancelled by JPB-X immediately after the Halt goes into effect.

In the event of a halt in an NMS stock imposed by JPB-X, it will not accept, match, or execute Firm/Conditional Orders in that NMS stock and will not accept instructions to modify, cancel, or replace Firm/Conditional Orders in that NMS stock.

Moreover, as noted in response to Part III, Item 3(a), JPMS reserves the right (i) to disable any JPB-X functionality, in whole or in part, if such functionality experiences technical issues or could otherwise pose a detrimental risk to Subscribers, JPB-X, or the capital markets and (ii) to restrict the entry of a Subscriber's Firm/Conditional Orders into JPB-X if certain thresholds are exceeded (e.g., risk limits imposed by JPMS pursuant to its obligations under SEC Rule 15c3-5)  or to mitigate operational risk by reducing the volume of messaging in JPB-X.  For instance, JPMS reserves the right to disable (i) the Close Price Match matching type in the event an exchange materially alters the functioning of its closing auction or (ii) one or both of the VWAP Price Match and Close Price Match matching types entirely when market conditions warrant a reduction of operational risk (e.g., in the event of excessive market volatility).</taPart3Item20aSuspndProcdur>
