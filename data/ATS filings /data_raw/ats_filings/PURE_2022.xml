Pursuant to those procedures, the CCO grants access to Subscriber Confidential Information as needed to enable employees to perform their duties and responsibilities. PURE employees with access to Subscriber Confidential Information are strictly prohibited from using such information in an unauthorized manner, including discussing Subscriber Confidential Information with any persons not involved in the operation of the ATS or responsible for the ATS's compliance with applicable rules.<br><br>At present, given (i) the number of employees at PURE; (ii) the scope of employee roles; and (iii) that the ATS is the only product offered by PURE, the CCO has granted all employees access to all Subscriber Confidential Information, on either a real-time or post hoc basis. As the number of employees at PURE increases, PURE's written policies and procedures will be amended to provide for more tiered or selective access to Subscriber Confidential Information.<br><br>Employees access the Subscriber Confidential Information primarily through PUMA (PureStream Monitoring and Analytics), PURE's proprietary application that is used in connection with trade monitoring, compliance obligations, and billing. Please see the response to Part II, Item 7.d below for additional information on the individuals and systems with access to Subscriber Confidential Information, including the basis for such access.<br><br>SEPARATION OF SYSTEMS AND PERSONNEL<br><br>The PURE ATS matching engine is hosted and operated by Ocean and is physically separate from the other PURE systems with access to Subscriber Confidential Information (e.g., PUMA). Similarly, the ATS matching engine and order entry servers are on separate hardware from other systems hosted and operated by Ocean. Additionally, the Ocean employees that are responsible for the daily operation of the ATS and that have access to the ATS's order book are in a separate physical location from PURE employees.<br><br>PURE is an agency only broker-dealer that exclusively operates the ATS and has no other lines of business or trading capabilities.<br><br>THIRD PARTY ACCESS PROTECTIONS:<br><br>Certain Ocean employees have access to Subscriber Confidential Information, including real-time and historical information regarding individual orders and executions, names of Subscribers, and volume of orders in the ATS. Such employees include Ocean staff from Compliance, Operations, Technology Development (including trading and surrounding systems), Product Management, and Business Management.<br><br>Ocean's policies and procedures (i) restrict which Ocean employees have access to Subscriber Confidential Information, and (ii) implement information barriers that prohibit employees with Subscriber Confidential Information from sharing such information in an unauthorized fashion, as well as (iii) impose personal trading limitations.<br><br>Ocean's policies and procedures employ a three-pronged approach to permission access to the PURE ATS. First, an Ocean employee must complete Compliance training specific to the Ocean business unit. Second, an Ocean employee must request, and Ocean Compliance must approve, access to each specific system based on the employee's designated role and responsibilities where such role and responsibilities require access to the PURE ATS. No other Ocean employees have access to the PURE ATS or Subscriber Confidential Information. Third, once approved, the Ocean employee must complete Ocean's annual Compliance training.<br><br>Ocean employees who have access to Subscriber Confidential Information are subject to Ocean's "Information Barriers and Conflict Management Policies and Procedures". Pursuant to these procedures, Ocean employees are prohibited from sharing Subscriber Confidential Information with other employees (including at Nasdaq) who are not expressly authorized to receive such information. All Ocean employees are also subject to Nasdaq's Global Trading Policy ("GTP"), which outlines all requirements and restrictions related to personal trading activity, including holding periods, annual attestations, IPO restrictions, and a prohibited list. Ocean employees are required to disclose personal investment and brokerage accounts, positions, and transactions. Nasdaq's Global Ethics Team monitors personal trade activities against the GTP. Ocean also conducts electronic communications reviews to identify policy violations, including non-compliance with the above-referenced policies and procedures.<br><br>In addition to the foregoing, Ocean maintains written policies and procedures concerning unauthorized disclosures, which include escalation procedures for such incidents. In this regard, Ocean will promptly notify PURE of any actual or suspected unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which includes Subscriber Confidential Information (so long as not prohibited by applicable laws, rules, or regulations).<br><br>PURE has the right to audit Ocean's operation of the ATS, including Ocean's access to and use of Subscriber Confidential Information, either through audits conducted by PURE's own audit team or by third-party auditors. Such audits may be conducted onsite or offsite.<br><br>PURE ATS ACCESS PROTECTIONS:<br><br>PURE possesses information that is sensitive and valuable, including the ATS's proprietary information and Subscriber Confidential Information. The exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals could cause irreparable harm to the ATS and its Subscribers and could subject the ATS to fines or other regulatory sanctions. Additionally, if ATS information is tampered or interfered with, damaged, or made unavailable, it could impair the ATS's ability to do business. Therefore, the ATS requires its employees to diligently protect both the<br>ATS's proprietary information as well as the Subscriber Confidential Information of current and former Subscribers.<br><br>Access to Subscriber Confidential Information is limited to PURE employees with a legitimate business need for the information. Presently, for the reasons explained above, this includes all current PURE employees. Hard copy documents must be secured by locking the file cabinet or office in which they are stored and shredded when it is timely and appropriate to destroy them. Subscriber Confidential Information kept on the ATS's computers must be password-protected and secured behind firewalls.<br><br>PURE also has detailed written firm-wide policies and procedures designed to monitor employee personal trading. To address potential conflicts of interest, PURE's employee trading policy requires: (i) disclosure of all personal trading accounts for activity monitoring purposes; and (ii) employees to provide advance notice to PURE Compliance of all personal transactions. Further, PURE employees are prohibited from entering orders for personal transactions while the ATS is open for trading (i.e., 9:30am to 4:00pm on business days, absent an early close or holiday). Personal trading that has an appearance of impropriety (e.g., potential front-running) is prohibited. On an annual basis, PURE employees participate in Compliance training that addresses information protection and Subscriber confidentiality. Additionally, on a firm-wide basis, PURE continuously monitors electronic communications to identify potential policy violations.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

				  </td><td><div class="fakeBox3">PURE is organized functionally into three teams: (i) a Subscriber-facing team; (ii) a Market Operations team; and (iii) an internal controls team. Given the size of the teams and the coordination necessary to service Subscribers, each team has access to all Subscriber Confidential Information, as defined in Part II, Item 6.a of this form. These teams primarily access Subscriber Confidential Information via PUMA (as referenced in Part II, Item 7.a. PUMA (PureStream Monitoring and Analytics), is a proprietary application used for real-time and end-of-day ("EOD") transaction monitoring. Among other things, PURE employees use PUMA in connection with: (i) monitoring transactional activity; (ii) Subscriber and regulatory support; (iii) compliance and risk monitoring; (iv) intra-day and EOD Regulatory reporting; and (v) billing. Only PURE employees have access to PUMA. In addition to PUMA, PURE's employee teams can also access Subscriber Confidential Information via Ocean's ATS monitoring application, OceanView, Nasdaq SMARTS Trade Surveillance, (an automated compliance application that facilitates PURE's monitoring of all trading activity on the ATS for compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and ATS policies by surveilling for potentially improper or disruptive trading activity), and BAML-provided applications for monitoring and resolving issues with respect to clearance and settlement.<br><br>With respect to the roles each PURE team plays, and the basis for access to Subscriber Confidential Information:<br><br>(i) The Subscriber-facing team stands ready to answer any questions by Subscribers and/or their clients. As a result, the Subscriber-facing team is monitoring order status, Subscriber trade reports, and the use of the ATS's order types by Subscribers to improve knowledge of and confidence in the ATS's novel matching and trading protocols.<br><br>(ii) The Market Operations team is responsible for the operation of the ATS. The Market Operations team monitors the ATS to ensure that it is operating as designed. This team also monitors for external market anomalies that could impact PURE ATS Subscribers and general system health. In addition to monitoring the system via PUMA, the Markets Operations team will have access to OceanView, Nasdaq SMARTS, and the BAML-provided clearance and settlement applications.<br><br>(iii) The internal controls team is responsible for risk, non-ATS technology, compliance, and operations. While not all functional responsibilities in the internal team require access to Subscriber Confidential Information, given the likely overlap of roles and supervision, all members of the team will have access to Subscriber Confidential Information, including via PUMA, OceanView, Nasdaq SMARTS, and BAML-provided clearance and settlement applications.<br><br>All PURE employees will receive annual training on Subscriber Confidential Information.<br><br>With respect to service-providers, both Ocean and BAML (PURE's fully-disclosed clearing broker) will have access to Subscriber Confidential Information.<br><br>In connection with the services Ocean is providing PURE, Ocean employees whose roles with respect to the ATS require access to such information, will have access to Subscriber Confidential Information, including orders, executions, and risk settings. These employees are from Ocean groups including Compliance, Operations, Technology Development (including trading and surrounding systems), Product Management, and Business Management.<br><br>In connection with clearing services provided, PURE's fully disclosed clearing broker, BAML, receives all of the executions of PURE ATS's Subscribers. Those details include the quantity, side, symbol, time, and price of execution. To effectively manage their risk, PURE's clearing broker is also aware of the gross level of orders and risk limits per Subscriber. As part of its relationship with PURE, BAML is obligated to protect all Subscriber Confidential Information, including data and information related to Subscribers.

It also sets forth<br>numerous examples meant to illustrate these principles.<br><br>Order Types<br><br>Each firm and conditional order sent to the ATS will include a symbol, size, price, market<br>side, a liquidity transfer rate (explained below), and a Time-in-Force, among other terms.<br><br>(1)	Streaming Block<br><br>Streaming Block orders are exclusively seeking a streaming match that references SIP-<br>reported trades using a matched liquidity transfer rate ("LTR").  PURE ATS has four<br>Streaming Block orders that Subscribers can use.  Each Streaming Block has an<br>associated minimum LTR and a maximum LTR that indicates the LTR range that the<br>Subscriber will accept.  A streaming match will have a matched LTR that satisfies both<br>matched orders (see Matching section in this Item and Part III, Item 11).  The matched<br>LTR is a rate percentage that PURE ATS uses to determine the size of child fills in a<br>streaming match.  More specifically, the size of the child fills in the streaming match is<br>the matched LTR percentage multiplied against the quantity of each SIP-reported trade<br>(SIP-reported trades are referred to as reference trades throughout this Form ATS-N)<br>subject to the ATS's minimum stream quantity conditions ("MSQ") in accordance with<br>the execution logic described in this item (see the MSQ example below in this item).  The<br>price of each child fill is the weighted average price of the reference trades that contribute<br>to achieving the MSQ (see the MSQ example below in this item).  Additional description<br>of the PURE ATS compatibility, matching, and execution logic is described below in this<br>Item under "Inter-Order Type Compatibility Ranking," "Matching" and "Minimum<br>Stream Quantity, Allocation, and Price Discovery".<br><br>Upon a child fill being effected (i.e., a trade being effected), the quantity of the child fill<br>is then decremented against the total quantity of the matched order (decrementing is<br>further explained and illustrated in "Inter-Order Type Compatibility and Matching" found<br>below in this Item).  The matched LTR can then be continuously applied to each<br>successive SIP-reported trade to create a series of child fills in a stream.  The stream can<br>continue over time, without any time limitations (during the course of an entire trading<br>day with any remaining quantities cancelled at the end of a trading day).<br><br> Streaming Block orders can be firm or conditional.<br><br>The Streaming Block orders are:<br><br>1.	10-200% ("200%")<br><br>This Streaming Block is seeking a child fill quantity of 200% of the quantity of each<br>contemporaneous SIP-reported trade but will accept at least 10%.  This means that<br>for a SIP-reported trade of 100 shares, the 200% Streaming Block will accept 200<br>shares to 10 shares for that child fill at the price of the SIP-reported trade.<br><br>2.	5-30% ("30%")<br><br>This Streaming Block is seeking a child fill quantity of 30% of the quantity of each<br>contemporaneous SIP-reported trade but will accept at least 5%.  This means that for<br>a SIP-reported trade of 100 shares, the 30% Streaming Block is seeking 30 shares to<br>5 shares for that child fill at the price of the SIP-reported trade.<br><br>3.	5-15% ("15%")<br><br>This Streaming Block is seeking a child fill quantity of 15% of the quantity of each<br>contemporaneous SIP-reported trade but will accept at least 5%.  This means that for<br>a SIP-reported trade of 100 shares, the 15% Streaming Block is seeking 15 shares to<br>5 shares for that child fill at the price of the SIP-reported trade.<br><br>4.	Custom LTR Range ("Custom")<br><br>This Streaming Block is seeking a child fill quantity based on the Custom parameters<br>entered.  Custom orders require both a minimum and maximum LTR, and must be<br>within the range of 1-500%; the minimum and maximum LTR of a Custom order<br>may be equal.  For example, a Custom order with a 2% minimum and a 4%<br>maximum, will accept 2 shares to 4 shares in a child fill referencing a SIP-reported<br>trade of 100 shares, at the price of the SIP-reported trade.<br><br>Note that the examples above are illustrative.  For the avoidance of doubt, PURE ATS<br>will only generate child fills in accordance with the MSQ conditions described below.<br><br>(2)	Liquidity Seeking ("LS")<br><br>This Order Type is seeking a single point match that references the NBBO.  If such<br>match is not available, LS orders will also accept a single point match referencing the<br>OCP (upon dissemination) up to the full quantity of its entire order or a<br>streaming match at the highest available LTR, in that order  (compatibility, matching, and<br>execution logic is described below in this Item under "Inter-Order Type Compatibility<br>Ranking," "Matching" and "Minimum Stream Quantity, Allocation, and Price<br>Discovery"). LS orders have an unlimited maximum LTR.  Subscribers can set a<br>minimum LTR for LS orders; otherwise, the default minimum LTR for an LS order is<br>.1%.  These orders can be firm or conditional.<br><br>(3)	Reference-on-close ("ROC")<br><br>This Order Type is seeking only a single point match that references the OCP for up to its full quantity (compatibility and matching and execution logic is described below in this Item under "Inter-Order Type Compatibility Ranking," "Matching" and "Minimum Stream Quantity, Allocation, and Price Discovery").  This Order Type will not match prior to the OCP being disseminated, will not<br>trade using any reference other than the closing price, and will not enter a streaming<br>match.  ROC orders do not have an LTR range but rather have an unlimited LTR.  The unlimited LTR for ROC orders cannot be changed. ROC orders must be firm orders.<br><br>Intra-Order Type Prioritization<br><br>PURE ATS uses intra-order prioritization logic to rank orders within the same Order<br>Type (note that for these purposes, Streaming Block is considered one Order Type).  This<br>section should be read in conjunction with the Inter-Order Type Compatibility Ranking<br>section below in this Item, and in Part III, Item 11, for purposes of ranking for matches.<br><br>Within each Order Type, firm and conditional orders are prioritized based on (i) LTR, (ii)<br>size of the order, (iii) marketability (as defined below), and (iv) time the order was<br>received, in that sequence.  The ATS processes (i.e., assesses for matching compatibility,<br>as described below) firm orders prior to conditional orders regardless of the order terms<br>of the conditional orders.<br><br>The first term considered in intra-Order Type prioritization ranking is the LTR.  Orders<br>are prioritized by the highest maximum LTR.  (The LS Order Type and ROC Order Type<br>always have an unlimited maximum LTR and therefore when prioritizing such orders<br>among like Order Types, PURE ATS will always need to look at least to the size of the<br>relevant orders).<br><br>The following example demonstrates the intra-Order Type prioritization if the ATS<br>received the three orders chronologically:<br><br>Buy Order 1: 15% Streaming Block<br>Buy Order 2: 200% Streaming Block<br>Buy Order 3: 25% (Custom) Streaming Block<br><br>Regardless of any other terms of the orders (e.g., size, marketability, or time), the intra-<br>Order Type prioritization would be based on maximum LTR, as follows:<br><br>Buy Order 2 (Highest maximum LTR)<br>Buy Order 3 (2nd highest maximum LTR)<br>Buy Order 1 (3rd highest maximum LTR)<br><br>For two orders with the same LTR, the second term considered in intra-Order Type<br>prioritization ranking is the size of the order quantity. The larger the order, the higher the<br>standing.  For example, if the ATS received the following three orders chronologically:<br><br>Buy Order 1: 15% Streaming Block, for 25,000 shares<br>Buy Order 2: 15% Streaming Block, for 5,000 shares<br>Buy Order 3: 15% Streaming Block, for 50,000 shares<br><br>The prioritization would be:<br>Buy Order 3 (50,000 shares)<br>Buy Order 1 (25,000 shares)<br>Buy Order 2 (5,000 shares)<br><br>The third term considered in intra-Order Type prioritization ranking (i.e., for orders that<br>are the same LTR and of equal size) is the marketability of the order.  The marketability<br>standard depends on the (i) relevant match type and (ii) reference point.<br><br>The marketability of an order for a potential streaming match is the difference between<br>the order's limit price and the contra-side NBBO.  For instance, if the NBBO is $10.01 x<br>$10.02 and the limit of a buy order is $10.05, the marketability of an order is .03.  The<br>greater the marketability, the higher the standing in terms of priority.<br><br>To illustrate prioritization for a potential stream match, if the ATS received the following<br>three orders chronologically:<br><br>Buy Order 1: 15% Streaming Block, for 25,000 shares, marketable by 4 cents<br>Buy Order 2: 15% Streaming Block, for 25,000 shares, marketable by 10 cents<br>Buy Order 3: 15% Streaming Block, for 25,000 shares, marketable by 6 cents<br><br>The prioritization would be:<br>Buy Order 2 (10 cents marketable)<br>Buy Order 3 (6 cents marketable)<br>Buy Order 1 (4 cents marketable)<br><br>An order is marketable for a single point match referencing the NBBO (this applies to LS<br>orders only) if the order's limit price at least satisfies its peg instruction (peg instructions<br>are described in Item 11c).  The more aggressive the limit price, the higher the standing<br>in terms of priority.  Single point-in-time trades are described below in the "Minimum<br>Stream Quantity, Allocation, and Price Discovery" section and Examples 9 and 10 of this<br>response.<br><br>An order is marketable for a single point match referencing the OCP (this applies to LS and ROC orders) if the order's limit price is at least through the OCP.  The more aggressive the limit price, the higher the standing in terms of priority.<br><br>The final term considered in intra-Order Type prioritization ranking (i.e., for orders that<br>are the same LTR, equal size, and have equal marketability) is the time the order arrived,<br>with priority being assigned chronologically.  Given the aforementioned prioritization<br>logic, it is by system design that orders arriving later could feasibly be given higher<br>priority than earlier arriving orders.<br><br>Minimum Marketability Threshold<br><br>For an order to be eligible for a streaming match, it must be marketable by a minimum<br>threshold (the "minimum marketability threshold") (minimum marketability thresholds<br>are not applied to single point matches).  The minimum marketability thresholds are set<br>on a stock-by-stock basis and are neither publicly available nor made available to<br>Subscribers and can be set at any integer, including zero.  PURE ATS can modify the<br>minimum marketability threshold for particular stocks to account for volatility, including<br>in the event of anomalous volatility of the overall market, relevant sector, or a specific<br>stock.  To monitor for circumstances that may warrant modifying the minimum<br>marketability threshold, PURE considers various volatility proxies such as the VIX,<br>Implied Volatilities, and Realized Volatilities of single stocks, sector indices, and/or<br>market-wide indices.  The minimum marketability thresholds are manually updated by<br>PURE Market Operations and are reviewed biannually.<br><br>For example, for a stock with a minimum marketability threshold of 2 cents that is<br>experiencing significantly higher price volatility, the minimum marketability threshold<br>could be increased to 4 cents.  This would require a buy order to have a limit of 4 cents<br>higher than the current national best offer, and a sell order to have a limit of 4 cents<br>below the current national best bid to be eligible for a streaming match.<br><br>PURE believes that modifications to the minimum marketability threshold in these<br>circumstances promotes matches that yield more efficient streams between Subscribers.<br><br>Note that minimum marketability thresholds are only relevant to the creation of a<br>streaming match (i.e., to be eligible for a match, an order must meet the minimum<br>marketability threshold).  Once an order is in a streaming match, so long as the order<br>remains marketable (i.e., the order's limit price is priced at or through its respective<br>NBBO farside), the order will remain in the match.  If a matched order ceases to be<br>marketable, the streaming match will end.<br><br>For example, if the NBBO is $10.01 x $10.02, for a stock with a minimum marketability<br>threshold of 4 cents, a sell order would need to be priced at $9.97 to be eligible for a<br>streaming match.  Once matched, the order would only need to remain marketable to<br>remain in the streaming match.  If the order became unmarketable, i.e., the NBBO moved<br>to $9.96 X $9.97, the streaming match would end.  To become eligible for a streaming<br>match again (with the previous matched order or any other order), the sell order would<br>again need to meet minimum marketability thresholds at the then-prevailing NBBO.<br><br>Inter-Order Type Compatibility Ranking<br><br>PURE ATS will only match orders of Order Types that are compatible.<br><br>(1)	Streaming Block Orders:  Streaming Block orders are compatible to match with LS and<br>Streaming Block orders, prioritized by Order Type in that order.<br><br>(2)	LS Orders:  The LS Order Type is compatible to match with the LS, ROC (if the LS<br>order is firm, and upon the dissemination of the Official Closing Print), and Streaming<br>Block orders, prioritized by Order Type in that order.  For the avoidance of doubt, ROC orders are ignored by the ATS for compatibility purposes until the dissemination of the OCP, and therefore until that time the ATS matcher will seek to match LS orders only with LS orders or Streaming Block orders (i.e., the presence of ROC orders on the ATS order book prior to the dissemination of the OCP does not inhibit matches of LS and Streaming Block orders).<br><br>(3)	ROC Orders:  The ROC Order Type is not compatible with any Order Type until the<br>Official Closing Print has been disseminated.  Until that point, ROC orders are not<br>eligible for any match and will remain resting on the ATS order book.  Upon the<br>dissemination of the Official Closing Print, the ROC Order Type is compatible to match<br>with ROC and firm LS orders, prioritized by Order Type in that order.<br><br>Matching<br><br>Matches are bilateral (i.e., between only two orders).  For a match to occur, two orders<br>must be compatible.<br><br>Compatibility means that among compatible Order Types (described above) there is (i) a<br>buy and sell order in the same security, (ii) both meeting the minimum marketability<br>threshold (not applicable to single point matches), (iii) with overlapping LTRs (i.e., the<br>LTR minimum to maximum range of one order overlaps with the LTR minimum to<br>maximum range of another order), and (iv) that any additional order handling instructions<br>sent with the orders (as described below in Part III, Item 11, Additional Order<br>Parameters) are satisfied.<br><br>In searching for a match for an order, the ATS first considers inter-Order compatibility<br>ranking.  If there are multiple compatible contra-side orders with equal inter-Order<br>compatibility ranking, the ATS will look to the intra-Order Type prioritization ranking of<br>the relevant orders.<br><br>The following examples illustrate the application of the PURE ATS inter-Order Type<br>compatibility logic (example assumes orders are compatible on all terms not reflected):<br><br>Example 1 - Incoming LS Order (prior to the Official Closing Print)<br>Orders 1-3 are resting on the ATS (all orders are firm).<br>Order 1 is a buy order for 5,000 shares in the LS Order Type.<br>Order 2 is a buy order for 5,000 shares in the 15% Streaming Block (min. of 5%, max. of<br>15%).<br>Order 3 is a buy order for 5,000 shares in the ROC Order Type.<br><br>Order 4 arrives in the PURE ATS and is a sell order for 5,000 shares in the LS Order<br>Type.<br><br>The compatible orders for Order 4 would be prioritized as:<br>Order 1<br>Order 2<br>Order 3 would not be ranked because the Official Closing Print was not yet disseminated.<br><br>Example 2 - Resting ROC orders<br>Orders 1-4 are resting on the ATS when the Official Closing Print is disseminated (all<br>orders are firm).<br>Order 1 is a buy order for 5,000 shares in the LS Order Type.<br>Order 2 is a buy order for 5,000 shares in the 15% Streaming Block Order Type (min. of<br>5%, max. of 15%).<br>Order 3 is a buy order for 5,000 shares in the ROC Order Type.<br>Order 4 is a sell order for 5,000 shares in the ROC Order Type.<br><br>The compatible orders for Order 4 would be prioritized as:<br>Order 3<br>Order 1<br>Order 2 would not be ranked because Streaming Block orders are not compatible with<br>ROC orders.<br><br>Example 3 - Incoming Streaming Block order<br>Orders 1 and 2 are resting on the ATS (all orders are firm).<br>Order 1 is a buy order for 5,000 shares in the LS Order Type.<br>Order 2 is a buy order for 5,000 shares in the 15% Streaming Block (min. of 5%, max. of<br>15%).<br><br>Order 3 arrives in the PURE ATS and is a sell order for 5,000 shares in the 200%<br>Streaming Block.<br><br>The compatible orders for Order 3 would be prioritized as:<br>Order 1<br>Order 2<br><br>Matches will result in the following: (i) streaming matches are created at the highest<br>possible LTR satisfying both matched orders (the highest LTR within the acceptable<br>range for each matched order); and (ii) single point matches are created at the highest<br>possible quantity that satisfies both matched orders.<br><br>If an order has residual quantity or LTR after being matched, the order's decremented<br>quantity or LTR will be available for other matches, meaning the order can be in multiple<br>matches concurrently.  Note that for prioritization purposes, a decremented order<br>maintains its original priority standing on the order book (e.g., an order using the 200%<br>Order Type with a residual 170% LTR following a match, is still treated as a 200% Order<br>Type for purposes of prioritization).<br><br>The following examples illustrate the interaction of Streaming Block orders with different LTRS:<br><br>Example 4 - Compatible LTRs:<br>Order 1 is a buy order for 5,000 shares in the 15% Streaming Block Order Type (min. of<br>5%, max. of 15%).<br>Order 2 is a sell order for 5,000 shares in the 15% Streaming Block Order Type (min. of<br>5%, max. of 15%).<br><br>These orders have overlapping LTRs because the LTR ranges of the orders overlap.<br>Thus, the orders are eligible to be matched.  The orders will be matched at 15%, which is<br>the highest common LTR between the two orders (in this example, this also happens to<br>be the maximum LTR for each order).<br><br>Example 5 - Incompatible LTRs:<br>Order 1 is a buy order for 5,000 shares in the 15% Streaming Block Order Type (min. of<br>5%, max. of 15%).<br>Order 2 is a sell order for 5,000 shares in the Custom Streaming Block Order Type, with<br>a 1% minimum and a 4% maximum LTR.<br><br>These orders do not have overlapping LTRs because Order 2's LTR range (1% to 4%)<br>does not overlap with Order 1's LTR range (5% to 15%).  Thus, these orders are not<br>eligible to be matched.<br><br>Example 6 - Compatible But Different LTRs:<br>Order 1 is a buy order for 5,000 shares in the 30% Streaming Block Order Type (min. of<br>5%, max. of 30%).<br>Order 2 is a sell order for 5,000 shares in the 15% Streaming Block Order Type (min. of<br>5%, max. of 15%).<br><br>These orders have overlapping LTRs because the LTR ranges of the orders overlap.<br>Thus, the orders are eligible to be matched.  The orders will be matched at 15%, which is<br>the highest common LTR between the two orders.  Order 1 will also have a residual LTR<br>of 15%, which will rest in the ATS order book awaiting other potential matches.<br><br>Example 7 - Compatible LTRs and Concurrent Matching:<br>Order 1 is a buy order for 10,000 shares in the 15% Streaming Block Order Type (min. of<br>5%, max. of 15%).<br>Order 2 is a buy order for 10,000 shares in the 15% Streaming Block Order Type(min. of<br>5%, max. of 15%).<br>Order 3 is a sell order for 20,000 shares in the 30% Streaming Block Order Type (min. of<br>5%, max. of 30%).<br><br>Here, Order 3 has overlapping LTRs with both Order 1 and Order 2, and has sufficient<br>LTR to match with both contra-side orders.  Therefore, Order 3 will enter two concurrent<br>matches, one with Order 1 and a second with Order 2.  In this way, Order 1 and Order 2<br>will satisfy their maximum LTR of 15%, and Order 3 will achieve its maximum LTR of<br>30% (two matches each at 15% LTR).<br><br>Example 8 - Compatible LTRs and Sequential Matching:<br>Order 1 is a buy order for 10,000 shares in the 30% Streaming Block Order Type (min. of<br>5%, max. of 30%).<br>Order 2 is a buy order for 10,000 shares in the 30% Streaming Block Order Type (min. of<br>5%, max. of 30%).<br>Order 3 is a sell order for 20,000 shares in the 30% Streaming Block Order Type (min. of<br>5%, max. of 30%).<br><br>Here, Order 3 has overlapping LTRs with both Order 1 and Order 2, but only has LTR to<br>match with one of the orders since the orders will be matched at the highest common<br>LTR -- here 30%.  Since Order 1 is prioritized over Order 2, Order 3 and Order 1 form a<br>match at a 30% LTR.  Order 2 will remain resting on the ATS order book.  However,<br>because Order 3 is larger in size than Order 1, Order 3 will have a residual 10,000 shares<br>to sell once Order 1's buy order is completed.  Therefore, once Order 1's quantity is fully<br>exhausted, Order 3 will form a match with Order 2, which will continue as a stream until<br>both Order 3 and Order 2 are fully exhausted (since Order 3's residual 10,000 shares to<br>sell is equal to Order 2's 10,000 shares to buy).<br><br>Please see ATS-N Part III ITM.7a for the remainder of this response.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">

Once the ATS identifies a potential match, the ATS will send a firm-up request to the conditional side of the potential match (where both sides of the match are conditional orders, the ATS generates a bilateral firm-up request for each conditional side of the potential match).

Note that if the ATS identifies a potential match for a contra-side firm order with another firm order (i.e., on the same side as the conditional order) prior to receiving a firmed-up order from the conditional side order (even after the firm-up request has been generated), the ATS will match the two firm orders ahead of the conditional order.<br><br>Quantity and Order Type changes to conditional and firm orders can be made in accordance with the procedures described in Part III, Item 7. Once conditional orders are firmed-up, the firmed-up orders are treated as Stream or Kill (SOK) orders.

This<br>section should be read in conjunction with the Inter-Order Type Compatibility Ranking<br>section below in this Item, and in Part III, Item 7, for purposes of ranking for matches.<br><br>Within each Order Type, firm and conditional orders are prioritized based on (i) LTR, (ii)<br>size of the order, (iii) marketability (as defined below), and (iv) time the order was<br>received, in that sequence.  The ATS processes (i.e., assesses for matching compatibility,<br>as described below) firm orders prior to conditional orders regardless of the order terms<br>of the conditional orders.<br><br>The first term considered in intra-Order Type prioritization ranking is the LTR.  Orders<br>are prioritized by the highest maximum LTR.  (The LS Order Type and ROC Order Type<br>always have an unlimited maximum LTR and therefore when prioritizing such orders<br>among like Order Types, PURE ATS will always need to look at least to the size of the<br>relevant orders).<br><br>For two orders with the same LTR, the second term considered in intra-Order Type<br>prioritization ranking is the size of the order quantity. The larger the order, the higher the<br>standing.<br><br>The third term considered in intra-Order Type prioritization ranking (i.e., for orders that<br>are the same Order Type and of equal size) is the marketability of the order.  The<br>marketability standard depends on the (i) relevant match type and (ii) reference point (see<br>Part III, Item 7).<br><br>The final term considered in intra-Order Type prioritization ranking (i.e., for orders that<br>are the same LTR, equal size, and have equal marketability) is the time the order arrived,<br>with priority being assigned chronologically.  Given the aforementioned prioritization<br>logic, it is by system design that orders arriving later could feasibly be given higher<br>priority than earlier arriving orders.<br><br>Inter-Order Type Compatibility Ranking<br><br>PURE ATS will only match orders of Order Types that are compatible.  See Part III, Item<br>7 "Inter-Order Type Compatibility Ranking" section for complete list of Order Type<br>compatibility rankings.<br><br>Matching<br><br>Matches are bilateral (i.e., between only two orders).  For a match to occur, two orders<br>must be compatible.<br><br>Compatibility means that among compatible Order Types (described above) there is (i) a<br>buy and sell order in the same security, (ii) both meeting the minimum marketability<br>threshold (not applicable to single point matches), (iii) with overlapping LTRs (i.e., the<br>LTR minimum to maximum range of one order overlaps with the LTR minimum to<br>maximum range of another order), and (iv) that any additional order handling instructions<br>sent with the orders (as described below in this Item 11, Additional Order Parameters) are<br>satisfied.<br><br>In searching for a match for an order, the ATS first considers inter-Order compatibility<br>ranking.  If there are multiple compatible contra-side orders with equal inter-Order<br>compatibility ranking, the ATS will look to the intra-Order Type prioritization ranking of<br>the relevant orders.<br><br>Matches will result in the following: (i) streaming matches are created at the highest<br>possible LTR satisfying both matched orders (the highest LTR within the acceptable<br>range for each matched order); and (ii) single point matches are created at the highest<br>possible quantity that satisfies both matched orders.<br><br>If an order has residual quantity or LTR after being matched, the order's decremented<br>quantity or LTR will be available for other matches, meaning the order can be in multiple<br>matches concurrently.  Note that for prioritization purposes, a decremented order<br>maintains its original priority standing on the order book (e.g., an order using the 200%<br>Order Type with a residual 170% LTR following a match, is still treated as a 200% Order<br>Type for purposes of prioritization).<br><br>Minimum Stream Quantity, Allocation, and Price Discovery<br><br>Single point-in-time trade execution logic:<br><br>When two orders eligible for a single point match are matched (e.g., LS-LS, firm LS-<br>ROC, ROC-ROC), they will execute a single point-in-time trade for the largest quantity<br>possible (i.e., the smaller quantity of the two orders matched).  Note that given the<br>minimum order size requirements for orders on PURE ATS, minimum stream quantity is<br>not applicable to single point-in-time trades.<br><br>The price of the single point-in-time trade will be set in accordance with the referenced<br>market data as dictated by the matched Order Types (e.g., the OCP or NBBO), the limit price, and peg instructions, if applicable, for the two relevant orders (executions will not violate an order's limit price).  Peg instructions (see Part III, Item 11c under "Peg Order Instructions for LS Orders") are applicable only to LS orders and are used (with limit prices) to determine compatibility for an LS-LS match and the price of any resulting single point-in-time trade.<br><br>Streaming matches:<br><br>Once a streaming match has occurred, the ATS will use each observed SIP-reported trade<br>in the relevant security as reference trades to execute "child fills" in accordance with<br>PURE ATS execution (see under "Order Types") and MSQ logic.<br><br>Note that each SIP-reported trade is only referenced once in each stream (and all<br>concurrent streams in the ATS reference each SIP-reported trade once).  The ATS<br>references SIP-reported trades in real-time as they are reported in succession (subject to<br>the filtering logic described in Part III, Item 23, below).  (To the extent that there are<br>malfunctions or other issues with the SIP that result in time gaps, the procedures set forth<br>in Part III, Item 20, below will be applied).  In the event that there is no SIP-reported<br>trade after the match is formed, the orders will remain matched but there will be no child<br>fills, and therefore no stream (i.e., a match can exist without a stream).<br><br>All streaming child fills are governed by the MSQ logic (for in detailed description of<br>MSQ logic see Part III, Item 7a, "Minimum Stream Quantity, Allocation, and Price<br>Discovery").<br><br>A stream will continue uninterrupted providing "child fills" as long as both orders remain<br>marketable (i.e., the orders' limit prices are priced at or through the contra-side NBBO),<br>have quantity remaining, and have not been cancelled.<br><br>Below is an example applying the ATS's streaming matching logic to a series of orders:<br><br>The ATS receives three Buy orders in the following chronology:<br>Buy Order 1: 15%<br>Buy Order 2: 30%<br>Buy Order 3: 200%<br><br>The prioritization of the orders will be:<br>Buy Order 3 (Highest maximum LTR)<br>Buy Order 2 (2nd highest maximum LTR)<br>Buy Order 1 (3rd highest maximum LTR)<br><br>For a marketable incoming sell order (Sell Order 4), using the 200% Streaming Block<br>Order Type:<br>Stream 1 would be created at an LTR of 200% between Buy Order 3 and Sell Order 4.<br>Buy Order 2 and Buy Order 1 would continue to rest because Sell Order 4's 200% rate<br>was completed.<br><br>For a marketable incoming sell order (Sell Order 5), also using the 200% Streaming Block<br>Order Type:<br>Stream 2 would be created at an LTR of 30% between Buy Order 2 and Sell Order 5.<br>Sell Order 5's available LTR is decremented to 170%.<br>And<br>Stream 3 would be created at an LTR of 15% between Buy Order 1 and Sell Order 5.<br>Sell Order 5's available LTR is decremented to 155%.<br><br>After the creation of Stream 2 &amp; 3, only Sell Order 5 will be resting in the order book with<br>a remaining LTR of 155%.

These parameters each limit potential counter-parties<br>or contra-side orders for a respective order; otherwise, the standard prioritization logic<br>applies to the impacted orders.<br><br>Further, Subscribers can route orders (via FIX) with minimum execution quantities<br>("MEQ") for (i) ROC orders and (ii) for LS orders where the Subscriber sets the minimum<br>LTR to be greater than the highest available LTR for all other available Order Types on<br>the ATS.  The effect of setting the minimum LTR at this level is to limit potential<br>compatible contra-side orders to only LS orders.  Where a Subscriber sets an MEQ for an<br>order, the order will only be matched in the ATS to a contra-side order that can satisfy the<br>MEQ (and is otherwise compatible with the order).<br><br>PURE ATS does not support post-only or counter-party segmentation or classification.<br><br>Peg Order Instructions for LS Orders:<br><br>PURE ATS requires peg instructions for all LS orders.  PURE ATS recognizes three peg<br>instructions: (i) Peg Far; (ii) Peg Mid; and (iii) Peg Near (defined below).  PURE ATS<br>will assign a Peg Mid instruction to (i) any LS order routed to the ATS without a<br>designated Peg instruction; and (ii) any LS order with a minimum LTR less than or equal<br>to 500%.<br><br>Peg instructions are effected only in the case of two LS orders (i.e., a Peg instruction will<br>not be considered for stream matches or for LS-ROC matches referencing the OCP).  PURE ATS uses the LS order's peg instruction and its limit price to determine the order's compatibility and the price for a potential single point-in-time trade.  The peg order instruction defines where an order is executable in<br>relation to the then-prevailing NBBO; the limit price defines where an order is executable<br>with respect to a set price point.  PURE ATS will not execute a single point-in-time trade<br>at a price that violates an order's peg instruction, and will never execute a trade that<br>violates an order's limit price.<br><br>For clarity, for LS orders:<br><br>*	Peg Far means that an order will be executed to (and including) the then-<br>prevailing contra-side NBBO (but not in violation of the order's limit price).<br><br>*	Peg Mid means that an order will be executed to (and including) the then-<br>prevailing NBBO midpoint (but not in violation of the order's limit price).<br><br>*	Peg Near means that an order will be executed to (and including) the then-<br>prevailing near-side NBBO (but not in violation of the order's limit price).<br><br>Note that as a result of this logic, an order with a marketable limit price and priority but<br>the most restrictive peg instruction (e.g., Peg Near) will not be eligible for a match where<br>the only contra-side interest has a Peg Mid or Peg Near instruction.<br><br>For illustrative purposes:<br><br>In a stock with an NBBO of $10.00-$10.10, a Buy LS order with a $10.20 limit price and:<br><br>*	Peg Far instruction is eligible for a single point-in-time trade up to $10.10;<br>*	Peg Mid instruction is eligible for a single point-in-time trade up to $10.05;<br>*	Per Near instruction is eligible for a single point-in-time trade up to $10.00.<br><br>In a stock with an NBBO of $10.00-$10.10, a Buy LS order with a $10.07 limit price and:<br><br>*	Peg Far instruction is eligible for a single point-in-time trade up to $10.07;<br>*	Peg Mid instruction is eligible for a single point-in-time trade up to $10.05;<br>*	Per Near instruction is eligible for a single point-in-time trade up to $10.00.<br><br>In a stock with an NBBO of $10.00-$10.10, a Buy LS order with a $9.99 limit price and<br>any Peg Instruction is not eligible for any trade because it is not marketable (the limit<br>price is below the near-side NBBO).<br><br>Price Limits, Marketability, Protection, and Improvement:<br>No orders will receive an execution that would violate the order's limit price.  In order to<br>optimize the creation of streams, the order book uses minimum marketability thresholds<br>required prior to an order being eligible to match (as described in Part III, Item 7).<br><br>There is no price improvement from, nor will the price vary from the price of the trades<br>referenced by the ATS.<br><br>Short Sales and Regulation SHO:<br>The ATS's Subscribers are limited to U.S. registered broker-dealers that are obligated to<br>comply with Regulation SHO Rule 203(b)(1).<br><br>When Regulation SHO Rule 201 short sale restrictions are in effect for a particular NMS<br>stock, PURE will cancel (previously accepted) and reject (incoming) firm and conditional<br>short sale orders in the relevant stock, except for short sale LS orders with a minimum<br>LTR greater than or equal to 501% ("Constrained LS Orders") that are permissibly priced<br>for execution.  The ATS will continue to execute such Constrained LS Orders pursuant to<br>the policies and procedures adopted pursuant to Rule 201(b) of Regulation SHO.<br><br>Locked and Crossed Markets:<br>PURE ATS will not execute single point-in-time trades when the market is crossed. PURE<br>ATS will only execute single point-in-time trades when the market is locked if both the<br>buyer and seller specify on the order that they are willing to execute during a locked<br>market.  During a (i) locked market or (ii) crossed market lasting less than 1 second, the<br>PURE ATS will reference all SIP-reported trades.  During a crossed market lasting longer<br>than 1 second, the PURE ATS will reference SIP-reported trades originating on an<br>exchange but will not reference SIP-reported trades originating on a Trade Reporting<br>Facility ("TRF").<br><br>Time Stamping of Orders and Executions:<br>Firm and conditional orders are timestamped at the time they are accepted by the system<br>in microseconds.  The formation of a stream and each trade fill is also timestamped in<br>microseconds.  The ATS will timestamp Subscriber firm and conditional orders in<br>compliance with FINRA time stamp and clock synchronization rules and guidance.<br><br>Errors:<br>PURE has Written Supervisory Procedures regarding errors, and errors will be handled<br>consistent with the firm's error policies.  For ATS (not Subscriber) errors, PURE<br>maintains an error account at its Clearing Broker (BAML) to book bona fide errors, and<br>to trade out of them.  Key elements of the ATS error policy include the following:<br><br>1) Errors must be escalated to the CCO immediately;<br>2) Errors must be corrected and documented as soon as practicable;<br>3) The ATS cannot be used to liquidate an error; and<br>4) PURE will not cover losses for Subscribers by treating transactions as errors when<br>they are not.<span> </span></div></td></tr><tr><td class="label">
